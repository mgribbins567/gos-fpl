Happy gameweek 31! Quick turnaround from these midweek games as waivers are due tomorrow morning at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This week saw mostly straightforward matchups, with the biggest upset coming from Gavin in his 37-30 win over MatthewR. We also saw Andrew pick up his 5th win of the season and Dylan squeak out a 26-25 win against Darryan.

Full results are as follows:

- Emily 39-52 Matthew
- Andrew 28-18 Jesse

This week sees very little movement around the table, as places 2-7 all picked up wins. In fact, the gap between MatthewR and Matt in second has been cut to 14! That means MatthewR now needs to win 4 of his remaining 8 matches to clinch the title! (and/or Matt drops enough points). Gavin in 7th is one of those who has relocated this week, with his head to head win over Rebecca keeping his gap with the leading pack to 6 points. Further below, Dylan's win over Darryan has him move past Emily on PF, up to 11th. Also, Andrew cuts the gap to Soph in 15th to just 13 points!

Now onto the Game Changers! One of the lowest scoring weeks this season, but a number of regulars have made it.

- Matthew: Anthony Elanga - Back to back double digit hauls from the Swedish winger led my team to victory as his lone goal against Manchester United secured the win, a clean sheet point, and 3 bonus points.
- Andrew: Jack Grealish - Not sure if anyone else heard his post match press conference, but he mentioned it was an especially emotional day for him and his goal meant a lot more because his brother passed away 25 years ago today (Jack was 4). He seems like a genuinely good guy so it's great to see he was able to get a start and a goal after a bit of a turbulent season for him. Hats off to him, and I'm really glad to be able to put him on this list today :)
- Matt: Marco Asensio - This guy's been showing up consistently for Villa since the transfer, bagging his 3rd goal and 1st assist in 5 games played (in the prem). That grabbed him 3 bonus points and 12 total for the ex-Madridista.
- Luke: Morgan Rogers - The young Englishman picked up 2 more assists on the season along with a clean sheet point and bonus point en route to 10 total in Aston Villa's 3-0 win at Brighton.
- Zach: Liam Delap - A big week for Ipswich as they upset Bournemouth 2-1 and pick up an important 3 points in the run in, with Delap scoring one of them and earning himself 3 bonus points in the process to lead Zach's team with 9.
- Dylan: Murillo - What a season it has been for Nottingham Forest and Murillo. Every time I watch Nottingham Forest I'm impressed by the young Brazilian and this week he picked up a clean sheet and 3 bonus points in their 1-0 win against Manchester United.
- Gavin: Savio - Another young Brazilian appears on this list, this time representing Manchester City well with an assist, clean sheet point, and 3 bonus for an important 9 total points for Gavin this week.
- Kevin: Alexander Isak - Certainly a week where this was the _less_ impressive of the two goals scored by Newcastle in their 2-1 win against Brentford. If you haven't seen it, go watch Tonali's goal. Right now. It's just absurd. Anyway, he's a forward so of course his goal came with bonus points: 2. Think rule of cool dictated that the Italian got all 3 this week, so Isak had to settle for only 8 points in this win.

April is extremely long at 5 gameweeks, so buckle in! The early lead goes to me, with 52 PF, but Luke, Matt, Gavin, and Zach all sit fairly close behind.

<br/>

In terms of the form table, we have a 4 way tie on 12/15 points earned! Zach leads with 228 PF, but is followed by me and MatthewR - each with 192 - and Luke on 190. And interestingly enough, Matt in 5th also has 190 PF.

Next week we start the cycle all over again, with our week 1 matchups repeating the final time! This means we should see some good matchups, headlined by Gavin vs Zach! Elsewhere, we'll see a midtable battle between Coop and Jesse, a top 3 matchup between Kevin and MatthewR, and another week of me vs Andrew! Will he score 52 against me? Will I score 52 against him? Who knows!

Full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew (16) vs Matthew (5)
- Soph (15) vs Emily (12)
- Coop (9) vs Jesse (10)
- Scott (13) vs Matt (2)
- Darryan (14) vs Luke (4)
- Gavin (7) vs Zach (6)
- Rebecca (8) vs Dylan (11)
- Kevin (3) vs MatthewR (1)

Shoutout this week to Luke for 4 wins in a row! Also, to Matt for going 3 undefeated(2W1D) along with myself, Dylan, and Zach for picking up back to back wins.
