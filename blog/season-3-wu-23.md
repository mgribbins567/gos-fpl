This week sees a bit of movement across the table, as the race for 3rd continues and the gap between the top and bottom half shrinks. Starting at the top, MatthewR keeps his 12 point lead over Matt, whose victory also confirms his 6 point lead over Kevin in 3rd. Just 1 point behind Kevin though is Zach, who has leapfrogged both myself and Luke, who sit 2 and 3 points behind, respectively. Jesse sits just 1 off Luke, and Gavin's win puts him just 2 points behind Jesse. Coop also joins the fray just 3 points off Gavin as they leap Dylan and Soph. Rebecca also gains a couple of positions as she joins Emily on 27 points, just 1 point behind the group of Dylan and Soph and 1 point ahead of Darryan.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week saw about the opposite of last week, as 6/8 game changers were in the double digits!

- Scott: Leandro Trossard - Trossard (and Martinelli) showed up this week as the duo combined for 17 points for Scott, with Trossard providing 10 points from 2 assists and 3 bonus points.
- Coop: Chris Wood - Wood picks up his 4th return in a row as Nottingham Forest hang on against Southampton 3-2 with a goal and assist coming from the Kiwi. That earned him 3 bonus points for 12 fantasy points for Coop.
- Gavin: Jean-Philippe Mateta - Back to back appearances on this list for Mateta as he picked up both goals in Palace's 2-0 win over West Ham for 13 points this week.
- Rebecca: Yankuba Minteh - The rare Minteh start paid off against Manchester United as the Gambian picked up a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points en route to a key 12 points for Rebecca.
- Kevin: Kevin de Bruyne - Kevin put in quite the performance for his namesake as he assisted 1/2 of Manchester City's 6 goals against Ipswich for 1 bonus point and 12 total points this gameweek.
- MatthewR: Harry Wilson - An important 7 pointer off the back of an assist, clean sheet, and bonus point led MatthewR's team to a narrow victory this week.
- Matt: Maxence Lacroix - Another back to back appearance on this list with the Crystal Palace defender finding his second clean sheet in a row along with a solitary bonus point for 7 total points, leading Matt's team.
- Zach: Justin Kluivert - For his second hat trick of the season, Justin surpasses his father's scoring record at St. James Park with only 1 penalty of the 3 this time. He also picked up an assist to take his total to 22 points on the week.

In terms of January Manager of the Month, we enter the final week with 3 undefeated teams! Zach takes a slight PF lead over Kevin and Gavin (although it is a large lead for the latter).
