Hello everyone, happy Thanksgiving and welcome to gameweek 13! Waivers this week are due at 5:30am PST / 8:30am EST on Friday! Highlights this week include Darryan taking a very close 32-30 win over Kevin, MatthewR picking up important points in a high scoring matchup against Dylan that ended 57-48, an upset for Scott as he defeated Jesse 42-31, and I held off Coop's solid week 52-42. Full results are as follows:

- Coop 42-52 Matthew
- Gavin 37-56 Zach
- Darryan 32-30 Kevin
- Jesse 31-42 Scott
- Dylan 48-57 MatthewR
- Luke 45-29 Matt

<br/>

Changes all across the table as just 1 person stays in their place! (Sorry Gavin...) Starting at the top, Darryan takes his top spot back this week due to Dylan's dropped points, keeping ahead of Luke on PF. Dylan is now joined on 24 points by MatthewR, who sits 3 points ahead of Zach and Jesse - the first of the two seeing himself move up the board on PF this week. I sit 6 points behind them after my win this week took me above Kevin by 1 PF, and Scott joins us as his win moves him above Coop and Matt on 12.

Game changers!

- Matthew: Murillo - 17 pts - A huge week for the Nottingham Forest center back as he slotted home a totally uncontroversial goal on a corner, picked up a clean sheet, and reverted to season 2024/2025 form with 19 defensive contributions... against Liverpool.
- Zach: Morgan Rogers - 15 pts - A double for the Englishman this week shows that while Watkins may be useless, there are some Aston Villa players who can score.
- Darryan: Rayan Cherki - 7 pts - When leaving 19 points on the bench, a game is won by fine margins, and an assist and somehow 2 bonus in a Manchester City loss to Newcastle won this one for Darryan.
- Scott: Eberechi Eze - 20 pts - What an absurd performance. To not only score against the team who almost signed you, but to do it in a NLD 3 times is unreal. What a player.
- MatthewR: Maxence Lacroix - 11 pts - MatthewR defense is BACK, this time led by an 11 pointer from the fizzy drink who picked up an assist, clean sheet, and 2 bonus points. Wait, that's not defcon.
- Luke: Harvey Barnes - 15 pts - This guy hates Manchester City (and has now scored the last 4 Newcastle goals in all competitions). Weirdly enough, the Manchester City one is the only win they got.

With just 1 more week in November, MatthewR and Scott are the only 2 undefeated managers, with the former ahead by 10 PF!

In terms of form, MatthewR takes the top spot with all 15 points earned in the last 5! Zach and Scott sit just behind with 12/15 points gained.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be an interesting one between myself and Luke! Elsewhere, in-form Scott takes on Darryan and MatthewR and Jesse face off in a top half matchup! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (7) vs Luke (2)
- Matt (11) vs Dylan (3)
- MatthewR (4) vs Jesse (6)
- Scott (9) vs Darryan (1)
- Kevin (8) vs Gavin (12)
- Zach (5) vs Coop (10)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 5 winstreak! Also to Scott for 4 in a row, and Luke and Zach for each picking up back to back wins!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): MatthewR, Scott, Kevin, Divya
Fell off: Kevin

10 - John (-2) - League B - While he is currently the most in-form manager (undefeated in the last 6), it does come with a duo of 35 pointers and the death of Gabriel. That said, he does have Bruno Fernandes, Szoboszlai, and (god bless) Mateta, so surely he won't be stuck in 35-point purgatory forever.

9 - Morgs (NEW) - League B - Morgs makes it back on the list (and at her new highest spot) after back to back 48+ point weeks. Keane looks like one of the best DEF in the game somehow, Crystal Palace defense is cruising, and Enzo is a goalscorer? Plus an insurance policy of Alexander Isak isn't too bad.

8 - Mack (+2) - League B - Swapping spots with John as Mack found herself with a 58 point week off the back of solid performances across the board, topped off by an Eze 20 pointer. And that's with Semenyo and Gyokeres both injured (and big Dan Burn suspended).

7 - ZachA (-) - League B - The B League streak continues as ZachA has another solid week off the back of a Chelsea clean sheet and some solid work by Cherki and Palhinha. Solid team but in a volatile state as the injuries start piling up and the defense is so reliant on Newcastle and Chelsea.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - I mean, I think my team is good, but I don't think I can crack into the top 5 without a few more good weeks and a lesser reliance on... 14 points from Munoz and 17 from Murillo. That said, 52 points with 2 players with 0 minutes on the field seems pretty solid.

5 - Zach (-) - League A - As Luke mentioned in the Discord earlier this week, Zach _might_ have the best team in the league if he has a FWD. Unfortunately though, he doesn't, so he is relying on Ekitike and Beto getting minutes here and there. That said, Tavernier while Kluivert is injured (and Bournemouth seems to be in disarray atm), Rogers and (possibly injured) Trossard in form. Not to mention this is the team that has Saka.

4 - Darryan (-2) - League A - Purely moving him down the list due to his bench situation. Leaving 28 points on the bench last week and 19 this cannot go unnoticed. Still, Cherki seemed a good pickup and he does have Haaland.

3 - Luke (+1) - League A - A solid week again for Luke off the back of a Barnes clinic against Manchester City, even with him leaving 12 on the bench. Marmoush is also back (with limited minutes), Delap is playing, and even though the Woltemade goal well seems to have at least temporarily dried up, he fills out a solid front 3 next to Thiago.

2 - Dylan (+1) - League A - Unlucky to lose this week, but another high 40-pointer for Dylan puts him top of the PF table in both leagues. Minteh has been a beast this season picking up 5 assists in the last 4 weeks, Welbeck is maybe the best striker in the prem, and Richards has only 2 2-pointers this season. Oh and also Salah is there.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - My second team has cut the PF lead owned by Dylan to just 3 with a 67 point week in the B League. Munoz and Rogers went off, Anderson has been in great form, and a forward line of Evanilson and Thiago is pretty good. Oh and also Salah is there.

Good luck all!
