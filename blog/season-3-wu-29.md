Happy gameweek 29! This week waivers are due on Friday, March 14th at 6:30am PDT / 9:30am EDT! This week saw some very close matchups, including Emily taking a really interesting 16-15 win over Jesse, Scott narrowly defeating Dylan 33-31, Luke fending off Soph 42-39, and Gavin pulling off the upset with his 39-35 win against Kevin. Coop also picked up a surprising win in his 50-41 win over Zach this week.

Full results are as follows:

- Rebecca 51-17 Matthew
- Kevin 35-39 Gavin
- MatthewR 46-23 Darryan
- Dylan 31-33 Scott
- Zach 41-50 Coop
- Luke 42-39 Soph
- Matt 25-15 Andrew
- Jesse 15-16 Emily

<br/>

This week sees a bit of movement across the table, with MatthewR keeping his 15 point gap over Matt, who pulls 3 points ahead of Kevin this week. However, Kevin's lead over 4th extends to 4 points as Luke leapfrogs me and Zach (again). Gavin and Rebecca's wins cut their gap behind Zach to just 3 and 6 points, respectively. Just 3 points behind Rebecca sits Coop, who passed Jesse this week with his win. Jesse now sits just 2 points ahead of Emily, who is newly followed by Scott after his win took him above Dylan to 12th.

Now onto the Game Changers!

- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - With 10 weeks left in the season, the Egyptian King has passed his FPL record of 303 points (now at 306)! This is his 5th 12+ point haul in the past 7 weeks (he also didn't score less than 6 in the other 2 weeks), this week from 2 goals and 3 bonus in Liverpool's win against Southampton for 15 total.
- Gavin: Bruno Guimaraes - With a quietly solid season coming from the Brazilian DM, he picked up his 3rd goal of the season in Newcastle's 1-0 win over West Ham. This secured him 3 bonus points and a clean sheet point to lead Gavin's team with 11 points.
- MatthewR: Joao Pedro - As Cole Palmer _missed his first penalty this week_, the actual ice cold penalty taker on MatthewR's team stepped up and dispatched his own to win Brighton's match vs Fulham 2-1 in the 95th minute. This was enough for 3 bonus (because FWD) and a 9 pointer to win the week for MatthewR.
- Scott: Jan Paul van Hecke - Making his first appearance on this list, the Brighton defender scored their _other_ goal, picking up a single bonus point to bring his total this week to 9.
- Coop: Marc Cucurella - Back to back 15 pointers for the Spaniard with the song. This repeat performance also saw him scoring a goal, keeping a clean sheet, and picking up 3 bonus points. This time against Leicester.
- Luke: Declan Rice - The trade from last week came up big, as Luke's new player hauled 10 points off Arsenal's lone goal in their 1-1 draw against United. That was enough for 3 bonus points and the difference in Luke's matchup this week.
- Matt: Luis Diaz - In a low scoring affair for Matt this week, Diaz picked up a single assist and bonus point in Liverpool's win, which amounted to a whopping 6 points, tied for Matt's highest scorer. (And narrow winner on BPS)
- Emily: Martin Odegaard - It took us 25 weeks but here we are again! A game changer with only 3 points. And you know what, that bonus point awarded to Odegaard was enough to make the difference in Emily's 1 point win against Jesse. Big week for the Arsenal captain.

In terms of March Manager of the Month, we're already halfway done! Due to the pesky international break, this month is only 2 gameweeks long. Currently, Rebecca has the lead (by 1 PF) over Coop, with MatthewR and Luke sitting closely behind in the 40s.

<br/>

In terms of the form table, MatthewR has made the climb back up, sitting as the only manager with 15/15 points earned! Rebecca, Luke, and Kevin are the trio sitting on 12/15 points earned in the last 5.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top half matchup between Gavin and Rebecca! Elsewhere, uhhh Darryan takes on Kevin? I'm gonna be honest here, we've got a bunch of top half vs bottom half matchups this week so anything could happen.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (5) vs Jesse (10)
- Emily (11) vs Matt (2)
- Andrew (16) vs Luke (4)
- Soph (15) vs Zach (6)
- Coop (9) vs Dylan (13)
- Scott (12) vs MatthewR (1)
- Darryan (14) vs Kevin (3)
- Gavin (7) vs Rebecca (8)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 5 winstreak! Also shoutout to Gavin, Luke, and Scott for each picking up back to back victories!
