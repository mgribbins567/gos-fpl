Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 15! Waivers this week were due this morning so free agency is open! Highlights this week include an enthralling 30-25 win by Luke against Scott, a high scoring victory for myself over Gavin by a score of 64-45, and Zach picking up a big win against Jesse 53-37. Full results are as follows:

- Gavin 45-64 Matthew
- Darryan 54-31 Coop
- Jesse 37-53 Zach
- Dylan 42-33 Kevin
- Luke 30-25 Scott
- Matt 38-52 MatthewR

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, not much changes at the top as Darryan and Luke's wins keep them ahead on 30 points. They lead the group on 27 led by Zach, who passes Dylan on PF this week. The two are joined by MatthewR, whose win takes him ahead of Jesse. The latter now sits just 3 points ahead of me, with Kevin and Scott sitting a win back as well.

And now, onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Phil Foden - 17 pts - Back to back braces for Phil as he decides maybe he doesn't want poor Erling to have to carry the burden himself. Insane 5-4 game against Fulham though.
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - 14 pts - This week Haaland decided to try his hand at playing the KDB role as he picked up a goal and 2 assists against Fulham in the aforementioned game.
- Zach: Marc Guehi - 14 pts - A solid week for Crystal Palace defenders as Guehi led the line with an assist, clean sheet, 13 defensive contributions, and all 3 bonus points in their 1-0 win against Burnley.
- Dylan: Jan Paul van Hecke - 12 pts - In another crazy game this week, Van Hecke pulled a Romero and scored 2 of Brighton's 3 goals against Aston Villa. They did however concede 4.
- Luke: Nikola Milenkovic - 6 pts - Big week for the big Nottingham Forest defender as they get a clean sheet and that's about it because they were against Wolves.
- MatthewR: Ollie Watkins - 13 pts - The Ollie truthers have come out of the woodwork for this one as our guy picked up a brace against Brighton (and could've scored more). This guy hates seagulls.

After the first week of December I take the lead on the Manager of the Month table on PF! Darryan, Zach, and MatthewR all join me with 50+ scores this week.

In terms of form, Zach, MatthewR, and Scott all sit atop the table with 12/15 points earned across the last 5!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be a great top of the table matchup between Zach and Darryan! Elsewhere, MatthewR looks to gain some ground at the top of the table with a match against Luke, an in-form Scott team takes on Dylan, and Kevin faces off against Jesse! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (7) vs Matt (10)
- MatthewR (5) vs Luke (2)
- Scott (9) vs Dylan (4)
- Kevin (8) vs Jesse (6)
- Zach (3) vs Darryan (1)
- Coop (11) vs Gavin (12)

Shoutout this week to Zach for 4 wins in a row! Also to myself for 3 in a row!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to week 4 of the Boxing Day Bash! Not a lot of close matchups this week, with the most interesting being my 64-42 win over Dylan in Group A! Over in Group A, Zach and Matt defeated Luke and Scott, respectively, to move to 6 points! Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Dylan 42-64 Matthew
- Jesse 37-52 MatthewR
- Coop 31-45 Gavin

These results see MatthewR all but punch his ticket to the knockouts with 9 points, I join Dylan on 6, and Gavin picks up his first 3 points to move out of the bottom 2.

Group B

- Darryan 54-33 Kevin
- Luke 30-53 Zach
- Matt 38-25 Scott

This group is extremely close as Zach and Matt take the top two spots on 6 points, Luke and Kevin sit on 4, and Scott and Darryan both are on 3 points.

That means there are some huge matchups next week, including Dylan vs MatthewR in Group A to possibly decide the group winner this week. Over in Group B, the two teams on 3 points (Scott and Darryan) go up against one another and Zach looks to stake his claim as the top team in a match against Kevin. Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Dylan vs MatthewR
- Jesse vs Gavin
- Matthew vs Coop

Group B

- Darryan vs Scott
- Luke vs Matt
- Zach vs Kevin

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): John, ZachA, Kevin, Matt
Fell off: John, ZachA

10 - Scott (-1) - League A - The curse of making the Power Rankings list hit Scott hard as he saw 8 points sit on his bench and a whole lot of 1s and 0s on the field. Even still, Neto has looked _very_ solid in recent weeks along with Bruno Fernandes. Who knows, could just be rotation due to the midweek games.

9 - Emma (NEW) - League B - Emma has been slowly moving onto my radar during her run of mid-30s and 40s gameweeks but back to back 50 point weeks has earned her a spot on this list. Granted, 4 goals from Foden between the two weeks definitely helped, but if Wirtz can get some points and White continues deputizing at RB her team is looking solid.

8 - MatthewR (NEW) - League A - Okay fine I'll put MatthewR (back) on the list. And it's not purely because Watkins got his first double digit return of the season. Okay maybe it is mostly that. Anyway, Odegaard is back, Tarkowski and Lacroix are defcon beasts, and Schade will soon be basically the only winger Brentford has once Dango goes to afcon.

7 - Mack (-) - League B - A solid week (read: highest score in League B) from Mack including 8 points from each of her new additions in Casemiro and Wieffer, along with defcon beast Semenyo leading the charge ahead of a Guehi 14 pointer. Plus, Gyokeres is back.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - A solid week (read: highest score in League A) from myself. Shoutout Foden and curses to whatever youth coach made Merino a midfielder because this guy is a beast going forward. Also, Munoz is the best defender in the game. If only I could get some players who play every game though...

5 - Darryan (-) - League A - A return to form that was just enough to keep me at bay, yet not enough to push further forward. Haaland is back to his goalscoring ways - wait, he got 2 assists? Welcome back Kevin de Bruyne. Also, Onana popped up with a goal, Arsenal kept a clean sheet (despite Timber being benched) and so did Nottingham Forest, because they played Wolves.

4 - Luke (-2) - League A - A bit of a rough week for Luke as he got the win but really only had the Nottingham Forest clean and Crystal Palace clean sheets (+ the Woltemessi assist) to show for it. I'm sure he'll be back but the midweek rotation scheme a few teams pulled really hurt his team.

3 - Dylan (-) - League A - Apparently Van Hecke is a striker now and Salah rides the bench? Anyway, definitely not a bad week from Dylan but the Mosquera injury definitely hurts, plus he's about to have to come to terms with losing his star player to afcon, Dango Ouattara. Oh and also Mo Salah is going to be gone too.

2 - Zach (+2) - League A - And up he goes again off the back of a Guehi 14 pointer and the second best goalkeeper in the league (Henderson). Rogers, Wieffer, and Saka all put in solid shifts as well, and Kroupi Jr got a start. Didn't do anything with it, but still.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Yet another good week from this team thanks to the Munoz and Richards returns alongside Hincapie clean sheet, Kudus finding an assist to Spurs striker Romero, and Rogers getting an assist to OLLIE. Anderson didn't get defcon though, so that was a bit disappointing.

Good luck all!
