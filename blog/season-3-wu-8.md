Happy gameweek 8! Thanks to the international break, waivers aren't due until next Friday the 19th, as 3am PDT/6am EDT. This week saw our highest scoring gameweek of the season so far, with managers averaging over 38.5 points! This meant we saw some very close, high scoring matchups headlined by Zach's 62-48 upset over Luke. Elsewhere, we also saw Darryan take a narrow 44-41 win against Coop and Matt continue winning in a key 43-38 victory over Dylan.

Full results are as follows:

- Scott 30-49 Matthew
- Darryan 44-41 Coop
- Gavin 41-28 Soph
- Rebecca 21-38 Andrew
- Kevin 28-30 Emily
- MatthewR 45-32 Jesse
- Dylan 38-43 Matt
- Zach 62-48 Luke

This week sees a ton of changes across the table, with just 1st and 7th remaining stationary. Starting at the top, Matt uses Jesse's loss to his advantage to leap into 2nd, just 2 points off the top. Darryan also gains ground, passing both Luke and Dylan to move up to 4th. Myself and Zach also join the group on 9 points, while 3 teams with 1 win doubled their win counts and moved up the table: Gavin, Andrew, and Emily.

Next up, the Game Changers! Another week with an interesting slate of players and a bunch of new names!

- Matthew: Bukayo Saka - With Saka's first week in this list comes a huge haul of 16 points. His undoubted Man of the Match performance tallied a goal, 2 assists, and 3 bonuses as he contributed to every Arsenal goal at the weekend.
- Darryan: Emi Martinez - During one of the early games on Sunday, Emi Martinez showed up with a clean sheet, 4 saves, and a pair of bonus points to secure a 0-0 draw against Manchester United and 9 points for Darryan. Not much to say about this one, I did not watch it.
- Gavin: Jordan Pickford - The second goalkeeper on this list, Pickford managed to make up for Tarkowski's stupid mistake and not only pick up a penalty save, but also a clean sheet, 3 saves, and 3 bonus points for his efforts for a total of 15 points.
- Andrew: Mateo Kovacic - Kovacic once again returns double digits for Andrew with 2 key goals en route to his victory and Man City's close 3-2 win against Fulham. A solid 15 points from him and the victory.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - In a crazy Brentford vs Wolves match this weekend which saw 8 goals scored, Cunha picked up all 3 bonus for his single goal, leading to a 9 point payout. Key bonus point distribution for Emily as she eeks out the win against Kevin.
- MatthewR: Georginio Rutter - In what has turned out to be a great waiver for MatthewR, Rutter scored and assisted for Brighton (+1 bonus point) to return 11 points to MatthewR's team, leading him to victory in what was a matchup between the top 2 teams.
- Matt: Mikkel Damsgaard - Following suit, Matt's Damsgaard pickup also worked out for him, as Damsgaard notched 2 assists and 2 bonus points for his 10 pointer and place as a game changer in the Matt vs Dylan match.
- Zach: Michail Antonio - I'm not even going to comment on the trade that lead to Michail Antonio being on Zach's team, but he picked up an insane 18 points from a goal, 3 assists, and the obvious 3 bonus points to lead Zach's team to a win against Luke.

In terms of October Manager of the Month, Zach takes an early lead on points for, narrowly leading the three Matt(hew)s and Darryan.

Looking at the form table again! As expected, MatthewR now sits alone at the top with 15/15 points gained, with Matt at 13 and Jesse at 12 out of 15.

Next week will see some great matchups for table position! Highlighted at the top by Matt vs MatthewR, with the winner taking control of 1st in what should be a great matchup. We'll also see a number of other interesting matchups between similarly ranked teams, including Luke vs Dylan, me vs Zach, Emily vs Rebecca, and Andrew vs Gavin. I expect we'll see another week full of midtable movement. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (8) vs Zach (10)
- Luke (5) vs Dylan (6)
- Matt (2) vs MatthewR (1)
- Jesse (3) vs Kevin (16)
- Emily (15) vs Rebecca (12)
- Andrew (14) vs Gavin (13)
- Soph (9) vs Darryan (4)
- Coop (11) vs Scott (7)

Shoutout this week to our sole 7 winstreak: MatthewR! Other undefeated streaks include Matt(7) and Darryan(4), everyone else is at square 1. Also, shoutout our 60+ pointer this week from Zach! This breaks his 5 match streak in the 20s.
