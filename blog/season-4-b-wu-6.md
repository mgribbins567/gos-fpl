Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 6! Waivers this week are due Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! Highlights this week start with our first draw of the season! A 22-all match between ZachA and Divya! Elsewhere, Chris picked up a key win 42-35 over Andrew, John continues his upward trajectory with a 44-33 win against Cara, and Alex picked up what could be an important result in a 52-39 win over Mack. Full results are as follows:

- Travis 18-41 Matthew
- Emma 25-46 Morgs
- ZachA 22-22 Divya
- Chris 42-35 Andrew
- John 44-33 Cara
- Mack 39-52 Alex

<br/>

This week sees myself go to 1st, just ahead of Alex on PF! We leapfrog ZachA, who sits on 10 points following his draw. Chris and Morgs also join the top 5 with their wins, moving ahead of Mack and Andrew. Further down the table, John's win moves him up to 8th and Divya's hard earned point pulls her up to 11th.

And onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Marcos Senesi - 9 pts - Boy am I glad that Schar had a concussion this week and needed the sub for Senesi (hope he's okay though he's been going through it lately injury wise).
- Morgs: Alex Iwobi - 13 pts - Apparently signing a young Brazilian winger named Kevin lit a fire under Iwobi because 1g1a is nothing to sneeze at.
- Divya: Yankuba Minteh - 9 pts - What a start to the season Minteh has had, and he capped off his week with a goal against Tottenham. How nice.
- Chris: Matty Cash - 10 pts - Idk how the Sunderland keeper _didn't_ save it, but fair play I guess. Finally broke Villa's streak of not being able to score (and they still drew the newly promoted side 1-1...)
- John: Bruno Fernandes - 10 pts - Can I give this to Robert Sanchez? I think he deserves this spot.
- Alex: Ryan Gravenberch - 15 pts - Isn't this guy supposed to be playing the 6?

With just 1 more gameweek in September, there is a 3-way tie on 6 points! Myself, Alex, and Morgs will be competing for the trophy this month! (and a reminder that my team can't actually win the prize but _can_ win the bragging rights).

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by myself vs Mack! Elsewhere, Alex looks to keep the pressure on at the top of the table with a matchup against John, Andrew hopes to take advantage of ZachA's poor form, and Divya and Emma square off to pick up some points in a congested midtable. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Mack
- Alex vs John
- Cara vs Chris
- Andrew vs ZachA
- Divya vs Emma
- Morgs vs Travis

And lastly, shoutout to Alex for picking up 4 straight wins! Also, shoutouts to myself for 3 in a row, along with Morgs for seeing out 2 back to back victories!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 6 of The League(tm) group stage! With just 3 matches to go, playoff spots are still up for grabs! Highlights from this round of matchups saw League B fighting back, picking up 5 wins out of 12 (having had 3W1D last week), led by Alex's victory over Luke 52-39! Elsewhere, Jesse picked up a narrow win against my B League team 44-41, Morgs follows in my league A result's footsteps and also defeats Darryan 46-26, and John picked up some key points in a close 44-38 victory over Coop. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 46-39 Mack
- Luke 39-52 Alex
- MatthewR 20-42 Chris
- Gavin 18-33 Cara
- Darryan 26-46 Morgs
- Kevin 34-18 Travis
- Dylan 34-22 ZachA
- Jesse 44-41 Matthew2
- Matt 49-35 Andrew
- Coop 38-44 John
- Scott 46-25 Emma
- Zach 42-22 Divya

And as for the table, Jesse takes his spot alone at the top on 15 points! He is just ahead of 5 managers boasting 4 wins and battling for the automatic quarter finals spot on PF (currently): MatthewR, Kevin, Dylan, Chris, and Zach. Myself, Alex, Darryan, and Andrew are 1 win behind that group, hoping for them to drop points in the final few weeks.

Next week will have some great matchups, headlined by two teams just on the cusp of a single week bye spot in Darryan vs Andrew! Other matchups of note include a couple of League A inviters vs League B invitees in MatthewR vs John and Coop vs Alex, two teams on similar PF in Zach vs Mack, and Scott hoping to put himself back into bracket qualification in a matchup against Chris. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Emma
- Luke vs Divya
- MatthewR vs John
- Gavin vs Matthew2
- Darryan vs Andrew
- Kevin vs ZachA
- Dylan vs Morgs
- Jesse vs Travis
- Matt vs Cara
- Coop vs Alex
- Scott vs Chris
- Zach vs Mack

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Zach, ZachA, Coop, Dylan
Fell off: ZachA, Dylan

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Credit where credit is due, Chris has put up 42+ points in 4/5 weeks this season (not really sure what happened week 3). His team is solid and if Watkins can start doing something - anything - he'll have a functional FWD to work with. Also, 20 points on the bench hurts.

9 - Kevin (+1) - League A - Another team with the Caicedo/DCL combo (except he left the opposite one on his bench this week), Kevin's got quite a few defcon players, he's just pretty reliant on Gyokeres/Joao Pedro/MGW for goals.

8 - Alex (NEW) - League B - Since Alex glanced the power rankings in gameweek 3, he's been on a tear, picking up a low scoring win in week 3, followed by two solid scores in weeks 4 and 5 to shoot him up the League B table. He's got 2 pretty solid FWDs in Bowen and Foster, a great mixture of DEFs from top teams, and some scoring potential in midfield from Ndoye/Damsgaard/Odegaard. A Gravenberch 15 pointer won't happen every week but I do think this team has a good base.

7 - Jesse (+1) - League A - I'm not really sure how he's done it, but he is now the highest scoring manager in both leagues. It helps that Chalobah somehow has _2 goals and 1 assist (+2 clean sheets)_ this season, but otherwise his team is solid. Doku is finding his feet, Isak is getting minutes (especially thanks to a stupid Ekitike red card in the Carabao cup game today), and Sarr should be back from injury soon.

6 - MatthewR (-2) - League A - Live and die by the 5 at the back. Sanchez red card doesn't help, but reports indicate Schade looked like schei√üe, Enzo is being run into the ground, and Aston Villa still looks pretty dire. He's got great PF, but a 20-pointer is rough.

5 - Mack (+1) - League B - Okay, I know she lost to #8 on the list, but hear me out: her team is 11th in luck, 1st in xP (being the only team to have outscored average every week), and 1st in the all manager table in League B. She also has the most PA in the Cup as well at 227. If she was given an average difficulty schedule, she'd be probably 4-1, but instead is 2-3 in both league and cup. Anyway, Strand Larsen is finally back from injury, Gyokeres doesn't have to play M(ourinho)chester City for another 4+ months, and Semenyo is the 2nd highest scoring player in the game.

4 - Darryan (-2) - League A - Just like MatthewR, except live and die by the Arsenal defense. That said, he's got a bit of a midfield problem and Jiminez is looking less and less likely to keep the starting job at Fulham. Even still, he's got Haaland so he'll be fine, just needs to score more than 1.7 points per player between the other 10 on the field.

3 - Matthew (+2) - League A - I mean, if my entire bench wasn't red I'd say the skies the limit for this team, but it is and I still scored 46 with Antonee Robinson playing 0 minutes on the field (although Jedi is apparently supposed to be back soon after starting in the Carabao today). So far this season, myself and Luke have the highest floor (38 points), which I think is a good measure for consistency so far.

2 - Luke (+1) - League A - Luke's team is certainly in an odd spot with reports saying Palmer will be out either no time at all or for 3-6 weeks, but I also can't put him below myself when my bench is a shade darker than his. Anyway, Senesi is a defcon beast, Ndiaye is the main man for Everton, and Thiago and Woltemade both appear to be solid pickups, especially with the Wissa timeline appearing to be post October international break.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Senesi did turn out to be an enormous get for this team as it just continues trucking along, overtaking ZachA both for 1st place and for top PF spot in League B. The only worry I think is if Ange decides Chris Wood isn't him anymore. Which, uh, would be an interesting decision.

Good luck all!
