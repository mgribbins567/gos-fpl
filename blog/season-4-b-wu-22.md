Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 22! This break was brought to you by the FA and Carabao cups so waivers are due Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST! Also, you may notice that some of the images in the update look different! That's because I finally decided to write a script to make me pngs of my Google Sheets cell ranges instead of doing it manually (in order to _hopefully_ save me time in the future). Some look a little weird and I'm still taking ~4 screenshots manually but it's a start. A few interesting matchups this week, headlined by Alex's narrow 44-41 victory over Andrew! Elsewhere, John defeated Morgs 42-35 and Chris beat Travis 36-29! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 60-25 Cara
- Andrew 41-44 Alex
- Divya 14-53 Mack
- Morgs 35-42 John
- Travis 29-36 Chris
- Emma 15-27 ZachA

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, John and I keep the status quo at the top as he maintains his 1 point lead over me, and I my 5 points gap over Chris. Below him, his lead extends to 4 points over Alex, who moves up the table 2 points above ZachA and Emma. Mack now sits just 1 point behind the duo, with a 3 point gap over Morgs.

Game Changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 12 pts - 5 goals in 2 games from the Brentford striker, taking his tally to 16 on the season. I really cannot praise this guy (and Brentford as a whole, honestly) enough for being so solid. Imagine thinking Brentford was relegation fodder at the beginning of the season.
- Alex: Bruno Guimaraes - 11 pts - Another goal and assist and 1 too many bonus points to keep his 10 point streak going. The Newcastle midfielder is not he 5th highest scoring player in the game, which is _wild_.
- Mack: Nathan Collins - 13 pts - Another huge week for Collins takes him above Van Dijk, etc. on points this season as he picked up his 3rd goal contribution in 2 games and second double digit return. Stick him up top with Thiago?
- John: Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 8 pts - Interesting point tally for DCL as he scored his 9th goal on the season (plus grabbed an assist), yet got a yellow card and no bonus points. The penalty BPS adjustment hits hard I guess.
- Chris: Harry Wilson - 9 pts - After a brief hiatus Messi puts his Harry Wilson poster back on the wall as he's scored in back to back weeks again. This time against Chelsea, as Fulham beat them 2-1, led by a Cucurella red card. Nice.
- ZachA: Benjamin Sesko - 13 pts - Interestingly, all it took was Amorim being fired for Sesko to score a brace. On the other hand, United drew 2-2 against Burnley. Can't win them all I guess.

40% of the way done with January and I lead the unbeaten pack on PF! I am joined by Alex, Chris, Mack, and John with 6 points earned this month.

In terms of form, John keeps his spot at the top with a perfect 15/15 points earned! Chris follows him closely with 13/15, and Mack has 4 wins in the last 5!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge match in the race for the top few spots between ZachA and Chris! Elsewhere, Morgs looks to bounce back against Alex, Emma takes on John, and we will see a Gribbins derby between me and Andrew! Full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew (10) vs Matthew (2)
- Divya (11) vs Cara (9)
- Morgs (8) vs Alex (4)
- Travis (12) vs Mack (7)
- Emma (6) vs John (1)
- ZachA (5) vs Chris (3)

Shoutouts this week to John for 7 wins in a row and Chris for 7 unbeaten (6W1D)! Also to Mack for 4 wins in a row, Alex for 3, and myself for back to back wins!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 3 of the knockout rounds of The League (tm) and our first quarter final round! We have finally exited the playoffs and every matchup from here on out will be two-legged! But first, the results from this week were headlined by a crazy matchup between Luke and Andrew in which the latter took the win 41-39 to extend his playoff run having now defeated both Allens! Elsewhere, the play-in managers continue their streaks as Alex defeated Kevin 44-39 and my League B team beat Chris 60-36. Darryan is the only 5th-8th place finisher to win, beating MatthewR 58-30. Full results of this round are as follows:

- Darryan 58-30 MatthewR
- Chris 36-60 Matthew2
- Luke 39-41 Andrew
- Kevin 39-44 Alex

This will set up some great quarter final matchups for the next couple of weeks, headlined by a Matthew Gribbins derby between my League A and League B teams (-,-)! Full matchups are as follows:

- Jesse vs Darryan
- Matthew vs Matthew2
- Zach vs Andrew
- Dylan vs Alex

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Matt, Luke, Emma, Andrew, Coop
Fell off: Emma

10 - Alex (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 32 (L), 38 (L), 61 (W), 58 (W), 44 (W) - `Meanwhile I'm over here glad that Matthew overlooked my 61 then 58 the two weeks before last update cause every time I'm in the rankings proper I throw up a stinker` -Alex, January 11th, 2026 at 4:13pm PST. Hate to do this to you but Morgs could use a win. Anyway, Tavernier seems to be destined to be the main man for Bournemouth with Semenyo off to City and Kluivert injured, which also provides Kroupi the opportunity to get some starts under his belt. Plus, Alex has surprisingly good FPL asset Bruno Guimaraes who _surely_ won't return double digits for the 4th week in a row, right?

9 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W), 42 (W) - Another win and another week sticking on the list for John as he continues riding the DCL train to victory as he scored and assisted to bring his g/a on the season to 11. On top of that, Gabriel is back with another return, Bruno Fernandes has risen from the dead to find they actually fired Amorim (and that he should start playing further forward), and Raul Jimenez spearheads a Europe-challenging Fulham team (idk if I expected this one...). That said, Paqueta may be shipping off to Brazil soon and Emi can't stop getting injured, so there are potentially some holes to fill.

8 - Chris (-1) - League B - Last 5: 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W), 36 (W) - A bit of a stumble for Chris this week as Saliba and the Welsh Messi were the only 2 players to pick up 5+ points, but not to worry as defcon beasts Tarkowski and Caicedo continue to put up their usual numbers (the number is 4). On top of that, Rice and Xhaka have high floors and Watkins just took a quick week off. That said, who knows what Reijnders' minutes will look like going forward, Wilson has already been banished by West Ham, and does anyone know if Barry is good? Please help.

7 - Mack (+1) - League B - Last 5: 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W), 53 (W) - That's now a 49 point per week average over the last 5 for Mack as she puts up another 50-pointer off the back of impressive performances across the board. Led by Nathan Collins the goat with his back to back double digit haul, 3 MIDs with defcon and Semenyo with his goal, a Guehi clean sheet and Woltemade assist, plus Strand Larsen sat the bench and morally supported the team with his own assist. The only question mark here is _what will Semenyo at City look like?_ And as of writing this, he's started 2 games and scored in both of them so that seems pretty good? On top of that G+ayokeres scored and assisted against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup so he is BACK.

6 - Kevin (-) - League A - Last 5: 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W), 39 (L) - Really a rough week for Kevin: Thiaw giving away 2 goals to Leeds in the first half and getting subbed at halftime on -1 point, Keane scoring against Wolves but then deciding to yank some hair to get sent off, Gravenberch hitting 8 defensive contributions in the first half against Arsenal just to end the game with _9_, all to lose by 1 point to me. Anyway despite Keane being suspended, MGW has 2 goals in 2, DCL is still on fire, and as mentioned 1 manager ago, Gyokeres is BACK.

5 - MatthewR (-1) - League A - Last 5: 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W), 30 (L) - MatthewR called this his "quad-weekly stinker" which is 50% true: yes it was a stinker, but it has been _5_ weeks since the 23 pointer. A 30 isn't that bad (the manager breakdown board doesn't discriminate between 30 and 39), but also Gordon and Enzo 1 pointers (including a 64 minute cameo for the latter - I thought he was nailed for 90 every week?), Kolo Muani looks to be a still unknown quantity and Solanke is BACK, and Dango returns soon which could hurt Schade's minutes. Although I doubt it. However, I have faith in Tarky/Lacroix/Odegaard/Watkins and :kai: has returned from injury.

4 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Last 5: 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L), 40 (W) - While my accursed streak of dropping players and seeing them score well continues (cough Mitoma cough), I did drop him for a player who scored _two_ goals. Maybe I'm cashing in on my past blunders? Maybe the FPL gods are looking down at my team and saying 'yeah let's give him a single digit win for once.' Either way my guys seem pretty solid if they can just score the damn ball (and not get only 1 defcon when at 10 at halftime). Semenyo has looked solid in a City shirt so far, Gakpo is doing something sometimes, and Tielemans somehow had 0.49 xGI against Crystal Palace... how tf did these guys not score. Anyway maybe Mateta will have used this nice break to lock in for the next 17 weeks.

3 - Zach (-1) - League A - Last 5: 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L), 40(L) - Unlucky loss for Zach this week so maybe Darryan _did_ invest in that Etsy witch. That said the interim manager did what Amorim could not and told the United players to pass the ball to Sesko and what would you know, he scored 2 (don't listen to how he told them to defend though). On top of the tall Slovenian lad Tavernier has looked solid this season and will only see more of the ball with Semenyo gone (_someone has to shoot 10+ times a game_), Casemiro has been a defcon beast, and Ekitike is already back. Huge get for Slot truthers.

2 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Last 5:55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W), 60 (W) - Back to back 60+ weeks after trusting my gut and picking up Janelt (11 and 7 pointers) and Mane (9 pointer) on top of solid performances from the whole squad tbh. Thiago has been enormous, Anderson, Senesi, Dorgu, and Janelt all bringing home assists, and Evanilson finally realizing he is a striker. Plus Munoz should be back shortly and Salah returns from afcon shortly with a 3rd or 4th place in hand thanks to Senegal.

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D), 58 (W) - Another huge week for Darryan not only in picking up the win but also in closing the PF gap with Zach as he somehow predicted a Brenden Aaronson 14 pointer to lead his useless Manchester City MID duo. Statistically, this means that Aaronson is worth 7x Cherki + Rodri, just sayin. On top of that, Raul, Evanilson, and Haaland continue their solid form as Darryan's FWD trio and Kelleher was gifted a penalty save. Oh and of course he left a Saliba 7 pointer on the bench.

Good luck all!
