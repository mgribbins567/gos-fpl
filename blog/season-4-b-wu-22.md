Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 22! This break was brought to you by the FA and Carabao cups so waivers are due Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST! Also, you may notice that some of the images in the update look different! That's because I finally decided to write a script to make me pngs of my Google Sheets cell ranges instead of doing it manually (in order to _hopefully_ save me time in the future). Some look a little weird and I'm still taking ~4 screenshots manually but it's a start. A few interesting matchups this week, headlined by Alex's narrow 44-41 victory over Andrew! Elsewhere, John defeated Morgs 42-35 and Chris beat Travis 36-29! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 60-25 Cara
- Andrew 41-44 Alex
- Divya 14-53 Mack
- Morgs 35-42 John
- Travis 29-36 Chris
- Emma 15-27 ZachA

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, John and I keep the status quo at the top as he maintains his 1 point lead over me, and I my 5 points gap over Chris. Below him, his lead extends to 4 points over Alex, who moves up the table 2 points above ZachA and Emma. Mack now sits just 1 point behind the duo, with a 3 point gap over Morgs.

Game Changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 12 pts - 5 goals in 2 games from the Brentford striker, taking his tally to 16 on the season. I really cannot praise this guy (and Brentford as a whole, honestly) enough for being so solid. Imagine thinking Brentford was relegation fodder at the beginning of the season.
- Alex: Bruno Guimaraes - 11 pts - Another goal and assist and 1 too many bonus points to keep his 10 point streak going. The Newcastle midfielder is not he 5th highest scoring player in the game, which is _wild_.
- Mack: Nathan Collins - 13 pts - Another huge week for Collins takes him above Van Dijk, etc. on points this season as he picked up his 3rd goal contribution in 2 games and second double digit return. Stick him up top with Thiago?
- John: Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 8 pts - Interesting point tally for DCL as he scored his 9th goal on the season (plus grabbed an assist), yet got a yellow card and no bonus points. The penalty BPS adjustment hits hard I guess.
- Chris: Harry Wilson - 9 pts - After a brief hiatus Messi puts his Harry Wilson poster back on the wall as he's scored in back to back weeks again. This time against Chelsea, as Fulham beat them 2-1, led by a Cucurella red card. Nice.
- ZachA: Benjamin Sesko - 13 pts - Interestingly, all it took was Amorim being fired for Sesko to score a brace. On the other hand, United drew 2-2 against Burnley. Can't win them all I guess.

40% of the way done with January and I lead the unbeaten pack on PF! I am joined by Alex, Chris, Mack, and John with 6 points earned this month.

In terms of form, John keeps his spot at the top with a perfect 15/15 points earned! Chris follows him closely with 13/15, and Mack has 4 wins in the last 5!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge match in the race for the top few spots between ZachA and Chris! Elsewhere, Morgs looks to bounce back against Alex, Emma takes on John, and we will see a Gribbins derby between me and Andrew! Full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew (10) vs Matthew (2)
- Divya (11) vs Cara (9)
- Morgs (8) vs Alex (4)
- Travis (12) vs Mack (7)
- Emma (6) vs John (1)
- ZachA (5) vs Chris (3)

Shoutouts this week to John for 7 wins in a row and Chris for 7 unbeaten (6W1D)! Also to Mack for 4 wins in a row, Alex for 3, and myself for back to back wins!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 3 of the knockout rounds of The League (tm) and our first quarter final round! We have finally exited the playoffs and every matchup from here on out will be two-legged! But first, the results from this week were headlined by a crazy matchup between Luke and Andrew in which the latter took the win 41-39 to extend his playoff run having now defeated both Allens! Elsewhere, the play-in managers continue their streaks as Alex defeated Kevin 44-39 and my League B team beat Chris 60-36. Darryan is the only 5th-8th place finisher to win, beating MatthewR 58-30. Full results of this round are as follows:

- Darryan 58-30 MatthewR
- Chris 36-60 Matthew2
- Luke 39-41 Andrew
- Kevin 39-44 Alex

This will set up some great quarter final matchups for the next couple of weeks, headlined by a Matthew Gribbins derby between my League A and League B teams (-,-)! Full matchups are as follows:

- Jesse vs Darryan
- Matthew vs Matthew2
- Zach vs Andrew
- Dylan vs Alex

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Alex, Matt, Luke
Fell off: None

10 - John (-3) - League B - Last 5: 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W) - Yep, that's 5 wins in his last 5, but he's seeing some cracks starting to form with DCL unable to score in back to back games, Mateta pulling off his usual disappearing act, and Gabriel being the only one to return. On top of that, KLP seems in and out of the starting 11, Everton's defense is evidently _not_ impenetrable, and O'Reilly's CS odds surely will suffer following the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias. That said, Bruno Fernandes is back soon, which is enormous for John's team. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the coming weeks.

9 - Emma (-3) - League B - Last 5: 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W), 50 (W), 28 (L) - Maybe a bit harsh for a (-3) after one off week, but she will be seeing the direct impacts of the Ruben Dias injury and more and more of her team is transitioning to the injury table or the bench. On the other hand though, Wirtz has been killing it recently, Trossard spent ~2/3 of the game on the bench resting up for the midweek match, and Foden could drop a 15 pointer at a moment's notice.

8 - Mack (+2) - League B - Last 5: 28 (L), 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W) - A solid last 4 for Mack as she slowly climbs up the League B table off the back of consistent performances from Collins, Casemiro, Miley, and Garner. Some solid defenders who consistently get defcon too... if only Gyokeres could score.

7 - Chris (+2) - League B - Last 5: 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W) - And the League B chain continues with the Declan Rice owner! On top of that, Reijnders decided to show up again for the _Festive Fixtures_, Xhaka continues his signing of the season level performances, and Harry Wilson is the next Messi. Solid 63 pointer for Chris this week.

6 - Kevin (+2) - League A - Last 5: 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W) - Really interesting tidbit here is that Kevin has now scored exactly 45 points 4 times this season. There are only 9 instances of 45 being scored in League A. Is there some sort of statistical probability that having a certain combination of returns makes you more likely to score _exactly_ 45 points? Maybe he continues to get 15+ point returns from his players and then a bunch of 2s, 0s, and 1s? Why is he never scoring in the low 40s? It's either 33-36 or 45 (or 50+). Just baffling and I don't have the statistics degree or mental energy to deduce this at 11pm at night. Maybe I'll write a theorem tomorrow to figure out how he does this. Anyway, nice week buddy.

5 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Last 5: 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L) - I'll continue using this as a platform to hate and overrate my team because honestly I know a lot of you guys just ctrl-f your name and see what I have to say about you. Anyway I would've done much better had Gakpo not hit the post and scored while offside, and if Wissa was like 2 inches less wide than he is. Or maybe if Mateta or Foden could actually do something every once in a while that would be nice. Anyway Gakpo did score and had a lot of chances so I'm not too upset with a loss. It was bound to happen.

4 - MatthewR (+1) - League A - Last 5: 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W) - Gavin didn't deserve this one bro... an Enzo Fernandez goal in the 94th minute to not only send Gavin into the shadow realm (930 PA btw) but also cause Darryan to salvage a _draw_ against Matt. Anyway, Watkins good, Odegaard good, Van de Ven good.

3 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Last 5: 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W) - Interesting what happens when I trust my gut and randomly sign _Vitaly Janelt_ who went on to get 2 assists and defcon. Maybe I should do that more often in League A. Anyway, solid performance to reconcile some of the past weeks' losses. Evanilson on the scoresheet (shoutout Gabriel), Anderson defcons away, Rogers gets an assist, and even Bart got a clean sheet.

2 - Zach (-1) - League A - Last 5: 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L) - Rough one this week for Zach as not only does he drop his first score in the 20s this season but he also loses Gvardiol to a broken leg bone (or somewhere in his ankle maybe? nobody posted the xray in the discord). Anyway his normal guys all did pretty well with Saka getting an assist off the bench, Rogers getting an assist while starting, and Casemiro somehow being Zach's best player and consistently being able to get points against some of the worst teams in the league. That said, he needs some of his other guys to show up (and maybe for Ekitike to not be injured... and be better than Gakpo at playing up top).

1 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Last 5:46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D) - You know what, 5 weeks at 40+ with a loss and a draw is quite a bit unlucky, especially when this week Evanilson's goal looms on the bench. But, weird circumstances turning a loss into a draw is what happens when you're at the top of the table. And that one point could make a difference. Also, a really interesting spread of point scorers from Darryan this week, a goal from Aaronson and Rutter, defcon from Xhaka, Cherki, and Rodri, an assist from Raul. Really a team effort to disappoint Matt. Well done taking top spot off the back of that.

Good luck all!
