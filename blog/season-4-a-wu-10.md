Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 10! Waivers this week are due Friday at 6:30am PDT / 9:30am EDT! Highlights from this week include a crazy come from behind victory for MatthewR over Gavin 47-44, a high scoring victory for Scott in an upset over Coop 47-42, and a huge upset from Matt as he put up the week high score in a 65-31 win against Darryan. Full results are as follows:

- Dylan 55-27 Matthew
- Luke 23-38 Jesse
- Matt 65-31 Darryan
- MatthewR 47-44 Gavin
- Scott 47-42 Coop
- Kevin 30-38 Zach

<br/>

In terms of the table, Darryan keeps his spot on top by just 2 PF over Dylan who leapfrogs Luke on PF to make it 3 managers on 21 points! Jesse sits 3 points back of the trio, with Zach and MatthewR another 3 points behind him. My loss sees me drop behind MatthewR, still level on points with Coop. Further down, Scott's win finds him move into 11th over Gavin.

And now, the game changers!

- Dylan: Dango Ouattara - Dylan's loyalty paid off as Dango unchained picked up a goal and assist against Liverpool as the bees go on to defeat the reigning champions 3-2. The math works out to 11 points for the Burkinabe.
- Jesse: Pedro Porro - Another assist for the Spurs right back as Tottenham went on to defeat Everton 3-0 on the road, picking up his 4th clean sheet of the season and another 11 pointer on this list.
- Matt: Matty Cash - Did he pick him up for his name? Or did he predict Cash scoring the lone goal for Aston Villa in their 1-0 win against Manchester City. 15 points for the most English Pole there is.
- MatthewR: Micky van de Ven - Well, well, well... if MatthewR didn't have a Season 2 Bowen happen for himself. Coming from behind to defeat Gavin's 44 pointer with a _23_ point performance from the Spurs center back. 2 goals, a clean sheet, 10 defcon, and all 3 bonus points to save Matthew's team from what looked like a big loss.
- Scott: Zian Flemming - I mean, what a performance in just his 2nd start of the season. 2 goals to win the game against fellow relegation candidates Wolves and 13 points for Scott to pick up a big win this week.
- Zach: Marcus Tavernier - The Tavernier merry-go-round ends up with Zach owning him for his goal and 11 point total week as Bournemouth defeated the coughing baby 2-0.

Congratulations to Zach for winning October Manager of the Month! He was the only undefeated manager across these 3 gameweeks!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by two huge top 4 matchups: Darryan vs Luke and Jesse vs Dylan! Elsewhere, Coop takes on MatthewR in what could be an interesting clash in the middle of the table, and Gavin and Matt both look to build on last week's scores against one another. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (7) vs Kevin (9)
- Zach (5) vs Scott (11)
- Coop (8) vs MatthewR (6)
- Gavin (12) vs Matt (10)
- Darryan (1) vs Luke (3)
- Jesse (4) vs Dylan (2)

Shoutout this week to Zach for 3 in a row! And to MatthewR and Dylan for picking up back to back victories!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): ZachA, MatthewR, Morgs
Fell off: Morgs

10 - John (NEW) - League B - Congratulations to John for making his first appearance on the list! This comes off the back of 3 very solid weeks. Szoboszlai looks like the best player by far on Liverpool, Gabriel has just been immense, and Mateta just keeps racking up xG. He's got a solid team with some in-form players so we'll see how he keeps up.

9 - Alex (-1) - League B - This is the start of some really difficult decisions I had to make in the ranking and unfortunately Alex got dropped a spot, even with a 47 pointer this week. Tavernier and Bruno G came up big and Bowen sure isn't going anywhere even though his team plays some of the worst football I've seen since... last season.

8 - Jesse (-2) - League A - Another decent week that got shifted due to having to sort of _dramatically_ rebalance the rankings. It does kinda work though, because Doku and Reijnders have been falling out of form as Jesse found just 7 points from his 4 playing midfielders.

7 - Zach (+2) - League A - Zach has been on a roll, and even with a slightly worse week than the past couple he picked up his 3rd straight win. A very helpful Tavernier pickup paid off, along with Guehi sneaking in some defcon and his 3 other midfielders all getting 3 pointers, which is interesting. Still, he's come back from his bit of bad (/unlucky) form and has been gaining points fast.

6 - Matthew (-3) - League A - Genuinely, I might have the most temperamental team in the league due to having so many injured players, but this week was rough. The guy who I picked up because he got 18/12/12/16 defcon in the 4 weeks before only got 4 defensive contributions, Murillo only hit 9, Foden has decided to vanish despite playing well, and Munoz and Mateta played Arsenal. So, a tough week for me.

5 - Dylan (+2) - League A - Really another solid week for Dylan with his second 50+ in a row. This time from Dango, Szoboszlai, and Gabriel all pitching in with 9+ pointers. And, he's still winning the Welbeck trade.

4 - Mack (+1) - League B - Not the best week for Mack but a win's a win, especially with 12 points sitting on the bench. Eze has looked solid and has been returning pretty regularly over the past 5 weeks, Guehi is Guehi, and Woltemade has been super solid recently (despite finally breaking his scoring streak). The only question marks are what's going on with Newcastle's MIDs - namely Elanga and Tonali - being benched.

3 - Luke (+1) - League A - Rough week for Luke as well seeing as he was joint lowest scorer across both leagues, but power rankings are a prediction for who will do well and he's coming off 3 wins in a row. Plus, he's got Delap now to make up for getting 6 points from his 4 midfielders.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Similar story to Luke (and Darryan) for this team, as the injuries to Evanilson and Chris Wood hit _hard_. Still an okay enough score, but barely in the 30s is certainly an off week.

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Let's be honest, he's still got Haaland and a bunch of Arsenal defenders - he'll be fine. Unlucky to not get any defcon this week though.

Good luck all!
