Happy gameweek 14! Unfortunately I missed the waiver deadline this week due to the super fast turnaround on midweek games, so the deadline is at 10am PST / 1pm EST **tomorrow** for waivers and setting your team! This week saw some nailbiters and high scoring matchups, headlined by MatthewR's close 40-38 victory over Darryan. Elsewhere, Andrew upset Matt 33-30, Emily upset Matt 27-24, and Kevin took a low scoring 3 points from his 23-26 final score against Gavin.

Full results are as follows:

- Rebecca 34-43 Matthew
- Kevin 23-16 Gavin
- MatthewR 40-38 Darryan
- Dylan 46-37 Scott
- Zach 50-38 Coop
- Luke 35-55 Soph
- Matt 30-33 Andrew
- Jesse 24-27 Emily

<br/>

Unlike last week, we see most of the table changing based on these results! In fact, the only managers to stay in the same position are MatthewR (1), Matt (2), Rebecca (7), and Andrew (16). Starting at the top, MatthewR's lead over 2nd extends to 11 points following Matt's loss to Andrew. This also gives way for Dylan and I to cut the gap on Matt to just PF difference and 1 point, respectively, as we round out the current top 4. This means Jesse and Luke drop to 5th and 6th, 1 and 3 points behind me. Meanwhile, Zach's win takes him back into the top half, level on points now with Gavin and also joined by Emily on 18. Kevin's win takes him just 2 points behind Emily, now abnove Coop and Darryan, and Soph's win this week moves her a point ahead of Scott to 14th.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week saw the highest cumulative sum of game changers players this season, with 109! That's an average of ~13.5 points per player on this list.

- Matthew: Bukayo Saka - Saka's back once again leading my team to another win. This time, he put together a 3 assist, 1 goal performance (and of course 3 bonus) en route to an 18 pointer. Which was handy, because I ended up with only 2 midfielders playing.
- Kevin: Milos Kerkez - A new name on this list! Kerkez put up a solid performance in Bournemouth's win this weekend, picking up one of their 4 goals and 7 points for Kevin.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - Palmer's 3-or-less streak ends with a 1 goal, 1 assist, 1 clean sheet, and 3 bonus point performance against Villa. Back to his usual self and provided just enough for MatthewR to squeeze by Darryan this week.
- Dylan: Evanilson - In a very odd statline, Evanilson picked up 3 assists via penalty wins (more on the pen taker next) and 1 bonus to provide Dylan with 12 total points.
- Zach: Justin Kluivert - As Evanilson continually drew silly fouls in the box, this man tucked them away, scoring the first ever premier league penalty-only hat trick! And yep, that's a 20 point performance because of course he got 3 bonus points.
- Soph: Marcus Rashford - Maybe Amorim is cooking, or maybe Everton is just bad. Either way, Rashford put 2 in the back of the net and picked up a pair of points from a clean sheet and bonus to lead Soph's upset over Luke with a 14 point performance.
- Andrew: Joshua Zirkzee - The United players back to back, Zirkzee turned this week around single-handedly as it seemed like Andrew's lead was starting to slip against Matt. Zirkzee scored the other 2 goals of that match, picking up 3 bonus points and 13 total points in the process.
- Emily: Jorgen Strand Larsen - Unfortunately for Wolves, they conceded 4 goals including 3 penalties. Fortunately for Emily, Strand Larsen scored their only 2 goals of the match along with picking up 2 bonus points for 11 total to narrowly take the win against Jesse.

Congratulations to Emily for winning November Manager of the Month! Her team was the only one to win out this month, picking up all 12/12 points and 14 more PF than anyone else. And a quick reminder about December: it's loooong! 6 whole gameweeks this year for the MotM race. Good luck!

In terms of the form table, Dylan sits at the top with 13/15 available points picked up! Behind him is a whole host of managers on 4 wins out of 5.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by me vs Jesse! Elsewhere, in-form Emily takes on Matt, Darryan hope to find some form in his lower half match against Kevin, and Gavin takes on Rebecca in a mid-table showdown.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (4) vs Jesse (5)
- Emily (10) vs Matt (2)
- Andrew (16) vs Luke (6)
- Soph (14) vs Zach (8)
- Coop (12) vs Dylan (3)
- Scott (15) vs MatthewR (1)
- Darryan (13) vs Kevin (11)
- Gavin (9) vs Rebecca (7)

**HUGE** shoutout this week to Game of Stones Season 2 participant (and also my sister) Morgan and Divya for getting married this weekend!!! Huge congratulations to them!!!

In fantasy shoutouts, Dylan has now reached 5 unbeaten (4W1D), Emily is at 4 wins in a row, and me and MatthewR are at 3!
