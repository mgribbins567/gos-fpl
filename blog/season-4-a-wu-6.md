Lots of upsets and interesting results this week, led by Scott putting up his first win of the season in a 46-20 victory against MatthewR.

Full results are as follows:

- Darryan 26-46 Matthew

<br/>

This week sees two big changes to the table: no more undefeated teams and no more winless teams! And as a result, Luke takes 1st place on PF! Just below our trifecta on 12 now sits Jesse, myself, and Coop on 9 points as our victories took us above MatthewR and Kevin.

And onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Neco Williams - After averaging just 1 point per week across the first 4 gameweeks, Williams finally shows his worth with Nottingham Forest's lone goal in a 1-1 draw against Burnley, good for 2 bonus points and 10 total. Ange ball is back?
- Jesse: Tijjani Reijnders - Reijnders pulled Jesse's sleigh this week off the back of a 9 point performance in Manchester City's 1-1 draw against Arsenal, where he picked up the assist for Haaland's goal, 12 defensive contributions, and 2 bonus points to put 9 total points into the sack.
- Coop: Alex Iwobi - The ever present Fulham midfielder put in a shift this weekend as his team evidently dominated Brentford 3-1, scoring his 1st goal of the season and notching his 2nd assist. A solid performance to net him all 3 bonus and lead Coop's team with 13.
- Zach: Dan Burn - Big Dan Burn put in a performance against Bournemouth in their 0-0 draw with 15 defensive contributions and 1 bonus point to lead Zach to his narrow victory this week.
- Matt: Jarrod Bowen - A second goal of the campaign for Bowen nabs him all 3 bonus points despite the 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace and a 9 pointer for Matt.
- Scott: Bruno Fernandes - Bruno's second 10-pointer(1 goal, 3 bonus points) in 3 weeks is just enough as that guy gets one step closer to being able to cut his hair. Now they just have to beat Liverpool in a few weeks' time...

With just 1 more gameweek in September, myself and Coop remain the only undefeated teams! I have a healthy PF lead going into this final weekend.

<br/>

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by our first Matthew derby between myself and MatthewR! Elsewhere, Scott or Matt will pick up two weeks in a row of points as they face off, Coop takes on Jesse in what should be an interesting battle to reach 12 points, and Kevin looks to hand Luke his second loss of the season. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs MatthewR
- Scott vs Matt
- Kevin vs Luke
- Zach vs Dylan
- Coop vs Jesse
- Gavin vs Darryan

And lastly, shoutouts to myself and Coop for being the only managers with winstreaks at 2 in a row!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 6 of The League(tm) group stage! With just 3 matches to go, playoff spots are still up for grabs! Highlights from this round of matchups saw League B fighting back, picking up 5 wins out of 12 (having had 3W1D last week), led by Alex's victory over Luke 52-39! Elsewhere, Jesse picked up a narrow win against my B League team 44-41, Morgs follows in my league A result's footsteps and also defeats Darryan 46-26, and John picked up some key points in a close 44-38 victory over Coop. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 46-39 Mack
- Luke 39-52 Alex
- MatthewR 20-42 Chris
- Gavin 18-33 Cara
- Darryan 26-46 Morgs
- Kevin 34-18 Travis
- Dylan 34-22 ZachA
- Jesse 44-41 Matthew2
- Matt 49-35 Andrew
- Coop 38-44 John
- Scott 46-25 Emma
- Zach 42-22 Divya

And as for the table, Jesse takes his spot alone at the top on 15 points! He is just ahead of 5 managers boasting 4 wins and battling for the automatic quarter finals spot on PF (currently): MatthewR, Kevin, Dylan, Chris, and Zach. Myself, Alex, Darryan, and Andrew are 1 win behind that group, hoping for them to drop points in the final few weeks.

Next week will have some great matchups, headlined by two teams just on the cusp of a single week bye spot in Darryan vs Andrew! Other matchups of note include a couple of League A inviters vs League B invitees in MatthewR vs John and Coop vs Alex, two teams on similar PF in Zach vs Mack, and Scott hoping to put himself back into bracket qualification in a matchup against Chris. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Emma
- Luke vs Divya
- MatthewR vs John
- Gavin vs Matthew2
- Darryan vs Andrew
- Kevin vs ZachA
- Dylan vs Morgs
- Jesse vs Travis
- Matt vs Cara
- Coop vs Alex
- Scott vs Chris
- Zach vs Mack

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Zach, ZachA, Coop, Dylan
Fell off: ZachA, Dylan

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Credit where credit is due, Chris has put up 42+ points in 4/5 weeks this season (not really sure what happened week 3). His team is solid and if Watkins can start doing something - anything - he'll have a functional FWD to work with. Also, 20 points on the bench hurts.

9 - Kevin (+1) - League A - Another team with the Caicedo/DCL combo (except he left the opposite one on his bench this week), Kevin's got quite a few defcon players, he's just pretty reliant on Gyokeres/Joao Pedro/MGW for goals.

8 - Alex (NEW) - League B - Since Alex glanced the power rankings in gameweek 3, he's been on a tear, picking up a low scoring win in week 3, followed by two solid scores in weeks 4 and 5 to shoot him up the League B table. He's got 2 pretty solid FWDs in Bowen and Foster, a great mixture of DEFs from top teams, and some scoring potential in midfield from Ndoye/Damsgaard/Odegaard. A Gravenberch 15 pointer won't happen every week but I do think this team has a good base.

7 - Jesse (+1) - League A - I'm not really sure how he's done it, but he is now the highest scoring manager in both leagues. It helps that Chalobah somehow has _2 goals and 1 assist (+2 clean sheets)_ this season, but otherwise his team is solid. Doku is finding his feet, Isak is getting minutes (especially thanks to a stupid Ekitike red card in the Carabao cup game today), and Sarr should be back from injury soon.

6 - MatthewR (-2) - League A - Live and die by the 5 at the back. Sanchez red card doesn't help, but reports indicate Schade looked like schei√üe, Enzo is being run into the ground, and Aston Villa still looks pretty dire. He's got great PF, but a 20-pointer is rough.

5 - Mack (+1) - League B - Okay, I know she lost to #8 on the list, but hear me out: her team is 11th in luck, 1st in xP (being the only team to have outscored average every week), and 1st in the all manager table in League B. She also has the most PA in the Cup as well at 227. If she was given an average difficulty schedule, she'd be probably 4-1, but instead is 2-3 in both league and cup. Anyway, Strand Larsen is finally back from injury, Gyokeres doesn't have to play M(ourinho)chester City for another 4+ months, and Semenyo is the 2nd highest scoring player in the game.

4 - Darryan (-2) - League A - Just like MatthewR, except live and die by the Arsenal defense. That said, he's got a bit of a midfield problem and Jiminez is looking less and less likely to keep the starting job at Fulham. Even still, he's got Haaland so he'll be fine, just needs to score more than 1.7 points per player between the other 10 on the field.

3 - Matthew (+2) - League A - I mean, if my entire bench wasn't red I'd say the skies the limit for this team, but it is and I still scored 46 with Antonee Robinson playing 0 minutes on the field (although Jedi is apparently supposed to be back soon after starting in the Carabao today). So far this season, myself and Luke have the highest floor (38 points), which I think is a good measure for consistency so far.

2 - Luke (+1) - League A - Luke's team is certainly in an odd spot with reports saying Palmer will be out either no time at all or for 3-6 weeks, but I also can't put him below myself when my bench is a shade darker than his. Anyway, Senesi is a defcon beast, Ndiaye is the main man for Everton, and Thiago and Woltemade both appear to be solid pickups, especially with the Wissa timeline appearing to be post October international break.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Senesi did turn out to be an enormous get for this team as it just continues trucking along, overtaking ZachA both for 1st place and for top PF spot in League B. The only worry I think is if Ange decides Chris Wood isn't him anymore. Which, uh, would be an interesting decision.

Good luck all!
