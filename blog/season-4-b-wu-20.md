Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 20, the new year, and the second half of the season! A quick turnaround this week with waivers due tomorrow morning at 3am PST / 6am EST! Not a ton of close matchups this week, but notable results include Alex's high scoring 61-22 win over me, Morgs' 43-27 upset over ZachA, and Mack's 51-37 victory against Cara! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 22-61 Alex
- Cara 37-51 Mack
- Andrew 27-46 John
- Divya 21-42 Chris
- Morgs 43-27 ZachA
- Travis 37-50 Emma

<br/>

A big change in the table this week as John takes advantage of my poor form and takes 1st by a point! I sit 5 points ahead of Chris and Emma, the latter of which just passed ZachA with her win. He sits just 1 point above Alex and Morgs, who keep a 3 point lead ahead of Mack with their wins.

Game Changers!

- Alex: Bruno Guimaraes - 10 pts - A huge week for a number of Alex's players, but especially Bruno G as he picked up a goal and all 3 bonus as Newcastle cruised to a 3-1 win against Burnley.
- Mack: James Garner - 16 pts - 19 defcon, a goal, assist, and clean sheet. Maybe next time he'll get more points than defensive contributions?
- John: Gabriel Magalhaes - 15 pts - Huge week for the corner merchant as he scored yet another and was subbed off before Arsenal conceded their obligatory "wtf was that" goal.
- Chris: James Tarkowski - 9 pts - Another big week for Tarky as he managed to somehow get as many defcon as James Garner. Apparently the key to playing good defense is the name "James"?
- Morgs: Nordi Mukiele - 11 pts - Continuing the streak of defenders is Mukiele, who led Sunderland's heroic defense against Manchester City. Thank you for your efforts toward Arsenal's title race o7.
- Emma: Leandro Trossard - 13 pts - From nearly leaving the club to re-signing with no extension to being one of the best Arsenal players this season. What a guy and effort against Aston Villa with a goal and assist.

Congratulations to Emma for winning December Manager of the Month with an undefeated 18/18 points! What a month!

In terms of form, John and Emma sit joint top with 15/15 points earned! Chris is just behind on 13/15!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge match between two very in form teams in Chris vs Emma! Elsewhere, I look to bounce back against ZachA, Mack takes on Morgs in the Henderson derby, and Travis looks to upset John! Full matchups are as follows:

- ZachA (5) vs Matthew (2)
- Chris (3) vs Emma (4)
- John (1) vs Travis (12)
- Mack (8) vs Morgs (7)
- Alex (6) vs Divya (10)
- Cara (9) vs Andrew (11)

Shoutouts this week go to Emma (of course) for her 9 weeks undefeated (8W1D)! Also to John for 5 wins in a row, Chris for 5 unbeaten (4W1D), and Mack for back to back wins!

# The League

And welcome back to The League (tm)! As a quick reminder to where we left off, we are in the first round of playoffs between the managers who finished 9th to 16th in our group stage table at the beginning of the season! The winners this week will go up against the managers who finished 5th through 8th next week, and then the winners of those matchups will face off against the top 4 managers from the group stage in the quarter finals! That means we will have some great matchups this week across the board, including a top of League B clash between my B team and John, what should be a great matchup between Mack and Alex, and an A League match between MatthewR and Matt! Full matchups are as follows:

- MatthewR vs Matt
- John vs Matthew2
- ZachA vs Andrew
- Mack vs Alex

And as a reminder for the current state of things, here is what the tournament looks like so far!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Cara, Alex
Fell off: Scott

10 - Mack (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 34 (L), 28 (L), 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W) - After a rough few weeks Mack was able to turn things around with a huge cup run, earning her the Boxing Day Bash trophy for League B and a place back on this list. There's a certain _je ne sais quoi_ to winning a trophy that meant she beat the other 3 or so names I could have put here. Anyway, she's got some very consistent performers as of recently, with Casemiro, Semenyo, Garner, and even Collins performing well week in week out.

9 - Chris (+1) - League B - Last 5: 51 (W), 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W) - Another solid performance and win for Chris off the back of Tarkowski and Van de Ven putting in very respectable performances. On top of that, Xhaka and Watkins look to be the 5 point merchants they were thought to be and even Wilson (the Callum one) is chipping in with a penalty win assist. The Rice injury is concerning, but _surely_ he isn't out too long... right?

8 - Kevin (-2) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L) - Sorry Kevin, welcome to being a yo-yo team. Rough time with Thiaw, Gravenberch, and (somehow) Konate being the only players to do anything. Plus, Caicedo is suspended next week, Keane hit his head on a bus door, and KDH and Pau are nowhere to be seen. But hey maybe DCL will be rested enough to stay onside next game?

7 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 74 (W), 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W) - 1st place in League B and playing a 523 due to injuries to Fernandes and KDH. Plus the 2 are both Leeds players, which is kinda wild? Anyway, Gabriel is all you really need to win these days and Mateta's once per two month goal finally happened (let's goooo).

6 - Emma (+1) - League B - Last 5: 57 (W), 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W), 50 (W) - With her win this week set the longest win streak of the season in either league! And what a performance it was, despite coming up just a hair short in the Boxing Day Bash final. Trossard is going off, somehow Zirkzee got all 3 bonus from his 45 minute appearance (I'm sorry to anyone who _did not_ hate watch the Manchester United vs Wolves game), and Robertson saw the field long enough to get his 2nd clean sheet of the season. 50 points is 50 points.

5 - MatthewR (-) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W) - It's no 77 pointer, but 50 points from a grand total of _zero_ double digit returns sounds pretty good. Tarkowski and Enzo made blue jerseys proud, Gordon, Odegaard, and Watkins all enjoyed 5 pointers, and Havertz showed up on the bench so that's a positive. :kai:

4 - Matthew2 (-2) - League B - Last 5: 33 (L), 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L) - Hey where'd all my points go?? Who knew when Kudus/Rogers/Evanilson/Thiago all do nothing and so do all my other players you end up with averaging _2_ points per player. Nice maybe we'll bounce back next week.

3 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Last 5: 36 (L), 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W) - It looked dicey in places but consistency is nice, especially with the little bit of matchup luck I've been getting recently. Weird scores this week as Mateta was the only player to do anything really, with Wissa picking up a goal (and no bonus), Semenyo an assist, and KLP a clean sheet from winger.

2 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Last 5: 38 (L), 46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L) - An unfortunate loss for Darryan but a solid score nonetheless as Timber dodged the CS wipe, Xhaka and Cherki prove they are the two best defensive midfielders in the premier league, and Calafiori benching unleashed a Leeds clean sheet from Bijol, which they got away at Anfield. Interesting.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 61 (W), 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W) - A _little_ fortunate to win this week, but a Trossard 13 and Matheus Nunes 11 will do it. Plus Opta seemed to enjoy Tavernier's performance so why not help him out a little too. Anyway, Gvardiol not starting is a little odd and apparently Rogers needs lower xG chances to be able to score, so Villa should try to get him more of those (for Zach's sake).

Good luck all!
