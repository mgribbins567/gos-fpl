Hello everyone and happy gameweek 2 of the Kickoff Cup! This week saw us kickoff our group stage that will go on to seed our tournament bracket, so let's get started! Let's see, starting alphabetically, Group A was the least interesting group, seeing as it remains in coefficient ordering. The closest of the matches was Darryan's 37-29 win over Jesse. Group B proved to be _very_ interesting, as Andrew got off to a hot start dropping 52 points en route to a win against Coop 52-20. Furthermore, Andrew saw his spot at the top cemented, as Gavin and Kevin celebrated(?) a 28-all draw. Group C - similarly - saw Scott off to a big lead as he defeated Dylan 47-20, but instead of a draw we saw Rebecca's single point 35-34 victory over Zach to take her level on points with Scott. Group D finally showed some normalcy... wait, nevermind, that's a 49-45 come from behind win for Matt over Luke to take pole position in the group. Full results are as follows:

**Group A**

- Matthew 42-21 Soph
- Darryan 37-29 Jesse

**Group B**

- Gavin 28-28 Kevin
- Andrew 52-20 Coop

**Group C**

- Dylan 20-47 Scott
- Zach 34-35 Rebecca

**Group D**

- Luke 45-49 Matt
- MatthewR 39-17 Emily

As this is just the first gameweek (and there is no elimination from the group stage), not a lot is set in stone, _but_ there will be some great matchups next week. Perhaps the most anticipated matchup comes from Group D, which averaged 37.5 points this week, in MatthewR vs Matt. These teams were each in the 40-50 point range and the winner can give himself a great chance at top 2 of the group. Elsewhere, we will see Gavin and Coop square off as they attempt to right the ships after a rough week 1, and Dylan and Rebecca run back their first week matchup in the league. Full matchups are as follows:

**Group A**

- Matthew vs Jesse
- Darryan vs Soph

**Group B**

- Gavin vs Coop
- Kevin vs Andrew

**Group C**

- Dylan vs Rebecca
- Scott vs Zach

**Group D**

- Luke vs Emily
- MatthewR vs Matt
