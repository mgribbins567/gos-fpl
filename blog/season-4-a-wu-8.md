Before I begin, I just wanted to give a quick plug for the Live page I've been working on for the website: https://www.gosfpl.com/live - it has live scores and tables from both leagues along with the cup, matchup breakdowns, and more! Check it out and if you have any feedback or suggestions for more features feel free to reach out! And back to our regularly scheduled programming...

Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 8 and our second international break of the season! Waivers this week are due Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! Highlights from this week are led by the reason this update took a week and a half for me to write: Jesse 50-47 me. Elsewhere, Luke defeated Gavin 48-43, Coop picked up 3 points in a close 26-23 win against Matt, and Darryan won the showdown at the top of the table with Dylan by a score of 44-35. Full results are as follows:

- Jesse 50-47 Matthew
- Dylan 35-44 Darryan
- Luke 48-43 Gavin
- Matt 23-26 Coop
- MatthewR 27-62 Zach
- Scott 21-33 Kevin

<br/>

This week sees Luke take the top spot by 3 PF, tied on 18 points with Darryan. Jesse joins the top 3 with his win, ahead of Dylan on PF. Coop's win takes him just 3 points behind the former two into solo 5th, and Zach sees himself move to the top of the managers on 9 points (me, MatthewR, Kevin) with his win.

And onto the game changers!

- Jesse: Mohammed Kudus - Sigh. Of course he picks up his highest point total of the season the same week as Semenyo. Anyway, Spurs beat Leeds 2-1 with the Ghanaian scoring and assisting for a 12 pointer.
- Darryan: Jurrien Timber - The Arsenal defense strat continues to work as Timber picked up his 4th goal contribution of the season along with a clean sheet as Arsenal defeated West Ham 2-0, taking home a solid 11 pointer for Darryan.
- Luke: Senne Lammens - The brand new United keeper picked up his first start and clean sheet this week with a solid display against the mighty offense of Sunderland. Anyway, his 3 saves earned him 2 bonus and a 9 point total.
- Coop: Marc Cucurella - The 0 point streak ends as Cucurella assisted an excellent extra time winner against Liverpool, picking up 2 bonus points in the process and leading both his team and Coop to narrow victories (7 total).
- Zach: Josko Gvardiol - Now at center back, the Croat played an honestly pretty standard through ball to Haaland who proceeded to man handle van den Berg to lead Manchester City to a 1-0 win. That meant a clean sheet, assist, and all 3 bonus points went to Gvardiol to hand Zach a 12 pointer.
- Kevin: Moises Caicedo - The other goal scorer in the Chelsea vs Liverpool game with an absolute screamer. Apparently he can do more than rack up defensive contribution as this was his 3rd goal of the season. This one was yet against enough for all 3 bonus and a round 10 points for Kevin's team.

As October has just started, Zach takes an early lead! He is followed by Jesse, Luke, and Darryan, who all also have 40+ PF!

In terms of form, the table is led by Jesse, Luke, and Darryan, who are sitting on 12/15 points earned!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 3 matchup between Darryan and Jesse! Elsewhere, we will see Kevin and MatthewR fight to reach 12 points, Coop take on Luke in hopes of pushing further into the top half, and Gavin look to pick up some points with a match against Dylan! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (7) vs Scott (12)
- Kevin (9) vs MatthewR (8)
- Zach (6) vs Matt (10)
- Coop (5) vs Luke (1)
- Gavin (11) vs Dylan (4)
- Darryan (2) vs Jesse (3)

And lastly, shoutouts to Jesse for 3 wins in a row and Darryan and Luke for putting together back to back wins!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 8 of The League(tm) group stage! We are now in the final gameweek, so after this week we will have to say goodbye to 8 of our closest friends. Anyway, some highlights from this week's slate of games include Chris's narrow 47-44 victory over Darryan, Morgs's 31-27 upset over MatthewR, John taking a big 3 points in a 39-35 win against Dylan, and Luke picking up an important high scoring win 48-40 against Travis. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 47-23 Cara
- Luke 48-40 Travis
- MatthewR 27-31 Morgs
- Gavin 43-55 Mack
- Darryan 44-47 Chris
- Kevin 33-22 Alex
- Dylan 35-39 John
- Jesse 50-31 Divya
- Matt 23-29 Emma
- Coop 26-47 ZachA
- Scott 21-33 Andrew
- Zach 62-37 Matthew2

And as for the table, Jesse has secured his spot in the top 4 with his win as the only undefeated team! He is followed by just 3 managers on 18 points who can each confirm their spots with a win this week. Those managers are Zach, Chris, and Kevin. Dylan and MatthewR fall down into the 5th-8th section, now even on points with myself and relying on a loss from one of the 3 mentioned earlier to move into the top 4. Just below is Luke, who sits on 13 points, 1 point ahead of Darryan, Alex, and Andrew who are just outside of the top 8. My second team, John, and Matt fill in the middle spots of the 9th to 16th group on 10 points, and ZachA and Mack sit precariously in the final 2 positions on 9 points. However, the two are _likely_ safe, as the 17th placed manager must win and overcome a 43 point PF deficit to qualify for the knockout rounds. That means, unfortunately, that the following teams are eliminated, or likely to be eliminated:

- Morgs (Must win + Mack or ZachA lose + overcome 43 or 48 PF deficit)
- Coop (Must win + Mack or ZachA lose + overcome 50 or 55 PF deficit)
- Scott (Must win + Mack or ZachA lose + overcome 95 or 102 PF deficit - lol)
- Travis
- Gavin
- Cara
- Emma
- Divya

A moment of silence for our fallen comrades o7

Anyway, next week will have some great matchups, headlined by a must-win matchup for Chris if he wants to finish top 4 as he takes on Luke, who is hoping to keep his place in the top 8. Elsewhere, I chase top 4 with a matchup against Alex, who is knocking on the door of top 8, MatthewR looks to do the same as me with a match against Mack, and Dylan hopes to squeeze into the top 4 with a win in a challenging match against my 2nd team. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (6) vs Alex (10)
- Luke (8) vs Chris (3)
- MatthewR (7) vs Mack (16)
- Gavin (21) vs Morgs (17)
- Darryan (9) vs Travis (20)
- Kevin (4) vs Cara (22)
- Dylan (5) vs Matthew2 (12)
- Jesse (1) vs Andrew (11)
- Matt (14) vs ZachA (15)
- Coop (18) vs Emma (23)
- Scott (19) vs Divya (24)
- Zach (2) vs John (13)

Good luck in the final week of the group stage!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Zach, Coop, Chris, Morgs
Fell off: Morgs

10 - ZachA (NEW) - League B - He's baaaaack, this time with defenders from only 2 teams: Chelsea and Newcastle. Anyway, I had trouble deciding between the two Benjamin Sesko owning Zachs and I think that A's supporting cast is a little more well-rounded. Sarr has been solid, Mbeumo picked up his 2nd return of the year, and Chalobah and Cherki are back from injury, meaning he sneaks onto this list.

9 - Dylan (-) - League A - With all the movement across this list, I didn't really know how to rate Dylan's team. He had a rough week (yet less rough than other teams in this list), and still has 295 PF. Plus, he has Salah, who is the king of FPL, even if he's looked invisible so far this season.

8 - Alex (-1) - League B - On the topic of rough weeks, Alex escaped what could have easily been a huge PD drop by losing only 23-22 this week. He's still in sole ownership of 2nd in League B though, and keeps his spot in the power rankings, for now. He is looking toward rough waters ahead with Odegaard out for ~1-2 months, Alderete injured on national team duty, and Spence and Sarr receiving dubious minutes, it _might_ be time to make some changes if he wants to make up for his losses.

7 - MatthewR (-3) - League A - The other Odegaard owner, MatthewR had a _slightly_ less disastrous week, yet he now sees a lot of yellow in key areas on his field. Odegaard is obviously out, along with Enzo this week, and Watkins injured during England duty. Plus, Kluivert scored his first screamer of the 2025/2026 season so Tav may see himself on a short leash. That said, he's got def con beasts across his backline, Gordon is back from his suspension, and Aston Villa remembered they should put the goal in the net, so he's probably fine.

6 - Mack (+2) - League B - A huge week from Mack as she takes the top score in League B off the back of Semenyo's 18 pointer and 17 points from the Burn/Woltemade duo. On top of that, Strand Larsen is fully back from injury, Eze is not pretty much nailed with Odegaard out, and Gyokeres will start scoring eventually, right?

5 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Considering I ended the week with 5 total players with 0 minutes and a Neco Williams 0 pointer to boot, 47 points is pretty solid. Surely my team will get off the surgery table soon :copium:

4 - Luke (-1) - League A - This was a tough decision, but these are _power rankings_ after all, so I decided to put Luke here. He still put up 48 points off the back of a double Manchester United clean sheet, but with Marmoush and Palmer out for extended periods of time he's awfully reliant on his 5 defenders plus Gakpo/Pino/Ndiaye, who have varying levels of reliability.

3 - Jesse (+2) - League A - Okay okay, maybe I've been slow in moving Jesse up the power rankings, but he's picked up his 3rd 50+ point week this season (while also logging a 49 pointer) and has kept his PF lead so here he goes. Kudus has looked solid, Porro _seems_ to be the 1st choice right back in the Premier League for now, Sarr is back at it, and Isak and Strand Larsen are picking up more minutes. Anyway, he also seems to at least have a little bit of the magic bullshit, with his last 2 wins coming with a +1 and +3 PD respectively.

2 - Darryan (-) - League A - The Haaland + Arsenal defense keeps delivering, as Darryan picked up yet another 40+ point week off the back of a Haaland goal and triple clean sheet return. Darryan's weakest part of his team is definitely the midfield, which is probably mathematically the easiest position to find waiver options for.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - I do still think this is the most well-balanced team, especially if Kudus continues his good form and Morgan Rogers continues his assisting streak. Oh yeah, and Salah is here too.

Good luck all!
