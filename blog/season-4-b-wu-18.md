Hello everyone, happy holidays and welcome to gameweek 18! Waivers this week are due Thursday at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST! Highlights from this week include a high scoring 55-52 match in which I added onto Mack's already brutal PA and took all 3 points, a crazy 47-47 draw between Cara and Chris, and a narrow win for Andrew over ZachA 38-36. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 55-52 Mack
- Alex 32-43 John
- Cara 47-47 Chris
- Andrew 38-36 ZachA
- Divya 15-35 Emma
- Morgs 33-28 Travis

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, I maintain my 5 point lead over John another week, while his gap above 3rd increases to 6 points. And, just as League A has a group sitting in 3rd, so does this one with Chris, Zach, and Emma all on 28 points. Just 1 point behind them are Alex and Morgs, with Cara sitting 4 points behind them following her _second_ tie of the season. Mack now sits 2 points behind, with the rest of the table looking about the same.

Onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Morgan Rogers - 15 pts - 4 goals on 1.81xg in the last 2 games and 2 15 pointers is wild work from the English attacking midfielder. Sorry Bellingham, Tuchel's found his starting CAM for the Euros.
- John: Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 13 pts - What can I say he's the goat and Everton should feel bad for letting him go for free. 6 goals in his last 5 games for _Leeds_.
- Chris: Declan Rice - 11 pts - The defcon machine keeps rolling as he gets his _3rd_ 20+ defcon match of the season, along with an assist for a Gyokeres penalty. Dango-esque.
- Andrew: Erling Haaland - 16 pts - Despite 5 0 pointers, Haaland was enough to find 3 points for Andrew this week as he scored twice and so generously assisted a teammate against West Ham.
- Emma: Florian Wirtz - 8 pts - In a game where Tottenham got 2 red cards and Van de Ven broke Isak's leg (no card btw), somehow the German midfielder got all 3 bonus from an assist.
- Morgs: Daniel Ballard - 9 pts - For being named after the neighborhood I live in, this dude's pretty good. Back to back clean sheets for Sunderland and regularly hitting defcon? What's not to like.

With 2 weeks left in December, Emma is still in the lead with 12 points earned! John is the lone manager on 9 points!

In terms of form, Emma keeps the streak going with 5 wins in the last 5! John is the sole manager with 12/15 points earned!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a matchup between 2 in-form teams in me vs Emma! Elsewhere, Chris will look to secure his spot in 3rd with a win against Morgs and Alex takes on Cara! Full matchups are as follows:

- Emma (5) vs Matthew (1)
- ZachA (4) vs Travis (12)
- Chris (3) vs Morgs (7)
- John (2) vs Divya (10)
- Mack (9) vs Andrew (11)
- Alex (6) vs Cara (8)

Shoutouts this week go to Emma for going 7 unbeaten (6W1D)! Also, shoutout to Chris for 3 unbeaten (2W1D) and to John for 3 wins in a row!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Cara, Chris, Alex, Luke, Dylan, Mack
Fell off: Alex, Dylan, Luke

10 - Matt (NEW) - League A - Welcome to the list Matt! 5 solid weeks in a row (a low of 38) off the back of solid performances from Cunha, Bruno G, and the Manchester City defenders. Bowen also seems to be one of the few forward picks who are worth a spot on the team, so he has that going for him as well.

9 - Kevin (NEW) - League A - A great few weeks from Kevin move him onto the list (unfortunately, he didn't follow up the 33/44/55 streak with a 66 :/). Calvert-Lewin being the spearhead over the last few weeks along with the highest scoring Liverpool MID: Gravenberch. Also, Pedro got another goal and Gyokeres was given a confidence pen.

8 - Scott (-1) - League A - A rough week for Scott both score-wise and injury wise, with Bruno (Fernandes) picking up his first injury in what, 5 years? this week. On top of that, Bradley is apparently injured (and Frimpong rose from the dead), Wilson broke his streak, and Eze somehow got 0 minutes.

7 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - He successfully bounced back from his off week with a solid performance (but a loss) with points coming from _not defenders_. Gordon looked really good this week, Watkins got an assist, and Andersen continues his streak of being perhaps the best defender for defcon.

6 - John (NEW) - League B - Should've probably been on this list last week, hence me introducing him so highly, but he recently broke out of the 30s with 3 very good scores (74/47/43) which have seen him solidify his spot in 2nd in League B. That said, he is the other Bruno (Fernandes) owner, and a lot of his points are coming from the best FWD in the league, DCL. However, he's got a solid team and will get KDH and Gabriel back soon.

5 - Emma (-1) - League B - Only 3 points from Foden this week but a decent score regardless as Wirtz somehow secured 3 bonus points in a wild game against Tottenham. Plus, Reece James is BACK (inb4 he gets injured this week), Trossard is back from injury, and Manchester City has 3 clean sheets in a row.

4 - Matthew (+1) - League A - 3 10 pointers this week from Hincapie, Robinson, and Semenyo, plus Truffert is apparently the defcon beast that was promised. Nobody else did anything but I guess they're probably saving their returns for later weeks for me. On the other hand, Pep is probably going to ruin Semenyo so

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - Darryan cementing his top 3 spot on this list with a huge 68 point week as Haaland continues Haalanding, Kelleher saved a pen, and Arsenal kept a clean sheet. Plus, he left 12 points on his bench.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Rogers in the form of his life, Bart 11 pointer, and Anderson/Senesi back to their usual defensive antics led me to a 55 pointer. That said, Richards bled all over the field and Hincapie is a question mark (and my bench is already a solid red color), so it might be a rough few weeks for me.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - The other Rogers team, plus 2 Manchester City defenders, Saka, and Ekitike (fresh off an Isak leg breaker from Van de Ven). Not much to say here as he continues his absurd run.

Good luck all!
