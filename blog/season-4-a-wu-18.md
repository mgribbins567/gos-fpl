Hello everyone, happy holidays and welcome to gameweek 18! Waivers this week are due Thursday at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST! Highlights from this week include a crazy 68-57 match between Gavin and Darryan where unfortunately the former fell just short in pulling off the upset! Elsewhere, Kevin upset Luke's usual score 45-37, Matt picked up 3 points against Scott 43-28, and I defeated the other Matthew 51-39. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 51-39 MatthewR
- Scott 28-43 Matt
- Kevin 45-37 Luke
- Zach 50-18 Dylan
- Coop 27-38 Jesse
- Gavin 57-68 Darryan

<br/>

Heading over to the table, Zach and Darryan keep pace with one another at the top, extending their lead over 3rd to 6 points. And that group on 30 points consists of 4 managers: Dylan, Jesse, Luke, and MatthewR. Kevin's win brings him just 3 behind the pack, with my win taking me above Scott on PF just 3 points behind Kevin. Matt keeps himself within striking distance just 3 points behind us.

Onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - 10 pts - He's back with goals in back to back games, this time scoring the only one for Bournemouth in a 1-1 draw against... Burnley. Bournemouth are you okay?
- Matt: Matheus Cunha - 9 pts - As many points as he had shots, but only the 1 goal from him is not enough as United lost 2-1 against Villa.
- Kevin: Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 13 pts - Haaland who? The ex-Everton striker now has scored in 5 back to back games, including a brace this week. Can't wait for him to win the Ballon d'or.
- Zach: Morgan Rogers - 15 pts - I mean, if I was Lenny Yoro maybe I wouldn't be so casual in closing down the guy who only scores from 0.02xg chances but what do I know.
- Jesse: Tijjani Reijnders - 8 pts - I guess it is Christmastime so why not have reindeer get a goal in Manchester City's 3-0 win over West Ham. How festive of Erling to let someone else score.
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - 16 pts - It was the Haalad show after all. Braces in back to back games my god he's going to break the scoring record isn't he.

With 2 weeks left in December, Zach still has the lead with 12/12 points earned this month! Darryan and Kevin are just behind on 9 points!

In terms of form, Zach of course sits on top of the table with 15/15 points earned! Kevin is the lone manager with 12 points earned in the last 5 weeks!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge top 3 matchup between Darryan and Dylan! Elsewhere, MatthewR looks to take points off of Zach, Jesse hopes to keep up his momentum in a match against me, and Matt takes on Coop! Full matchups are as follows:

- Jesse (4) vs Matthew (8)
- Dylan (3) vs Darryan (2)
- Luke (5) vs Gavin (12)
- Matt (10) vs Coop (11)
- MatthewR (6) vs Zach (1)
- Scott (9) vs Kevin (7)

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Cara, Chris, Alex, Luke, Dylan, Mack
Fell off: Alex, Dylan, Luke

10 - Matt (NEW) - League A - Welcome to the list Matt! 5 solid weeks in a row (a low of 38) off the back of solid performances from Cunha, Bruno G, and the Manchester City defenders. Bowen also seems to be one of the few forward picks who are worth a spot on the team, so he has that going for him as well.

9 - Kevin (NEW) - League A - A great few weeks from Kevin move him onto the list (unfortunately, he didn't follow up the 33/44/55 streak with a 66 :/). Calvert-Lewin being the spearhead over the last few weeks along with the highest scoring Liverpool MID: Gravenberch. Also, Pedro got another goal and Gyokeres was given a confidence pen.

8 - Scott (-1) - League A - A rough week for Scott both score-wise and injury wise, with Bruno (Fernandes) picking up his first injury in what, 5 years? this week. On top of that, Bradley is apparently injured (and Frimpong rose from the dead), Wilson broke his streak, and Eze somehow got 0 minutes.

7 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - He successfully bounced back from his off week with a solid performance (but a loss) with points coming from _not defenders_. Gordon looked really good this week, Watkins got an assist, and Andersen continues his streak of being perhaps the best defender for defcon.

6 - John (NEW) - League B - Should've probably been on this list last week, hence me introducing him so highly, but he recently broke out of the 30s with 3 very good scores (74/47/43) which have seen him solidify his spot in 2nd in League B. That said, he is the other Bruno (Fernandes) owner, and a lot of his points are coming from the best FWD in the league, DCL. However, he's got a solid team and will get KDH and Gabriel back soon.

5 - Emma (-1) - League B - Only 3 points from Foden this week but a decent score regardless as Wirtz somehow secured 3 bonus points in a wild game against Tottenham. Plus, Reece James is BACK (inb4 he gets injured this week), Trossard is back from injury, and Manchester City has 3 clean sheets in a row.

4 - Matthew (+1) - League A - 3 10 pointers this week from Hincapie, Robinson, and Semenyo, plus Truffert is apparently the defcon beast that was promised. Nobody else did anything but I guess they're probably saving their returns for later weeks for me. On the other hand, Pep is probably going to ruin Semenyo so

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - Darryan cementing his top 3 spot on this list with a huge 68 point week as Haaland continues Haalanding, Kelleher saved a pen, and Arsenal kept a clean sheet. Plus, he left 12 points on his bench.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Rogers in the form of his life, Bart 11 pointer, and Anderson/Senesi back to their usual defensive antics led me to a 55 pointer. That said, Richards bled all over the field and Hincapie is a question mark (and my bench is already a solid red color), so it might be a rough few weeks for me.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - The other Rogers team, plus 2 Manchester City defenders, Saka, and Ekitike (fresh off an Isak leg breaker from Van de Ven). Not much to say here as he continues his absurd run.

Good luck all!
