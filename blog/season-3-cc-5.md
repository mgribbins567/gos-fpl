Hello everybody and welcome to gameweek 5 of the Champions Cup! Also known as Gameweek 2 of **Group Stage 2**! This week saw some quite close and interesting matchups throughout all of our groups. The closest of which came in Group F, where Gavin took a 24-21 win over MatthewR. Elsewhere, we saw Andrew beat Scott 19-12 in Group G, Dylan defeat Rebecca 33-25 in Group E, and Coop take a 27-20 win over Jesse in Group H.

Full results are as follows:

**Group E**

- Rebecca 25-33 Dylan
- Zach 48-28 Matt

**Group F**

- MatthewR 21-24 Gavin
- Kevin 19-46 Luke

**Group G**

- Scott 12-19 Andrew
- Soph 4-36 Darryan

**Group H**

- Coop 27-20 Jesse
- Emily 28-52 Matthew

Looking ahead to next week, we should see some good matchups, with 3/4 of the winners from each group matching off against each other! I'd say the most interesting matchups will be Rebecca vs Matt from Group E, Gavin vs Luke in Group F, and Emily vs Jesse fighting for their first points in Group H. Full matchups are as follows:

**Group E**

- Rebecca vs Matt
- Zach vs Dylan

**Group F**

- MatthewR vs Kevin
- Gavin vs Luke

**Group G**

- Scott vs Darryan
- Soph vs Andrew

**Group H**

- Coop vs Matthew
- Emily vs Jesse
