Happy gameweek 4! And welcome to the first international break of the year! As the players go off and get injured playing for their home nations, we get to sit and wait until Friday, the 13th of September at 3am PDT / 6am EDT for waivers to process! This week had some great matchups, highlighted by Scott's nail-biting 21-20 win against Emily. Elsewhere, Jesse picked up his 3rd win of the season in a close 36-32 matchup against Darryan, Zach took a narrow 25-18 lead over Kevin to take home 3 points, and Matt put up the highest score of the week in his 63-13 win over Gavin.

Full results are as follows:

- Soph 26-38 Matthew
- Coop 36-21 Andrew
- Scott 21-20 Emily
- Darryan 32-36 Jesse
- Gavin 13-63 Matt
- Rebecca 33-41 Luke
- Kevin 18-25 Zach
- MatthewR 41-26 Dylan

This week sees the same 3 teams as last week undefeated! Matt moves into top spot of the table on Points For, surpassing MatthewR and staying above Jesse in 3rd. Further down the table, Luke and Zach join Scott on 2 wins and round out the three teams on 6 points. Further down, myself and Coop pick up our first wins of the season, moving into 7th and 13th respectively.

Next up, the Game Changers! This week had some fun ones as some matches just didn't have anyone to take the obvious spot.

- Matthew: Andy Robertson - Yay my first player on this list. This one was difficult since I had a grand total of 4 players on 6 points this week, including Robbo. However, Robertson has been on 6 points _every week_ so for that (as a defender) he has earned this spot.
- Coop: Chris Wood - Another difficult one (and Coop's first player here) is Chris Wood. This legend scored the only Nottingham Forest goal in a 1-1 draw against Wolves, picking up a goal and 3 bonus to total 9 points. Solid week from Wood.
- Scott: Son Heung-Min - Well, it had to be someone from this team. Somehow, Scott won with 21 points, lead by a solid 3 pointer from Son. And no, the extra point was not a CS, it was a bonus point. In a game where there were 3 goals scored. Yeah..
- Jesse: Calvert-Lewin - Jesse's plot armor continues to hold up as DCL of all people put up a very respectable goal, assist, and 3 bonus points (totalling 12 points) as he finished the game watching his team throw away a 2-0 lead to lose 2-3 to Bournemouth. MotM though!
- Matt: Haaland - "I'm sick of writing these match ball" "Fuck off!" - Manchester City players signing Haaland's second hat trick ball this season. 'oh look at me I score hat tricks for fun' yeah sure bud find a new hobby. 17 points.
- Luke: Eze - Finally, Eze finds the back of the net after taking his 15th shot of the season, ending Luke's contemplation of dropping him and granting him 10 points from a goal and 3 bonus this week.
- Zach: Alisson - Alisson joins the elite double Game Changer group of Haaland and Son with a clean sheet, 3 saves, and a bonus point in an 8 point week. Liverpool seems to be the only team to keep consistent clean sheets, and Zach hasd profited twice now.
- MatthewR: Joao Pedro - A solid week from MatthewR lead by Joao Pedro, who tapped in a goal against Arsenal's 10 men (sigh) and picked up 3 bonus en route to 8 total points and a MatthewR victory.

Congrats to Matt for winning August Manager of the Month! 2 huge hat tricks (and another goal) by Haaland and Luis Diaz figuring out how to score lead him to 1st in the Points For column, over MatthewR and Jesse, and has won him this month. Some solid performances at the top and very well done by the new manager!

Next gameweek sees a new month and a clean slate! September only has 3 gameweeks (thanks international break), so it's anyone's to claim!

Form table still on pause :)

Next week should see some great matchups! Starting at the top, our first Matthew derby of the season! Perhaps I will be the one to stop MatthewR's unbeaten run, or will be make it 4/4? Elsewhere, Dylan takes on Kevin in what should be an interesting matchup, and a lower table matchup between ~~Wolves~~Emily and Coop along with Andrew vs Soph will likely see the winners shoot up the table. Full matchups are:

- Matthew (7) vs MatthewR (2)
- Dylan (8) vs Kevin (11)
- Zach (6) vs Rebecca (9)
- Luke (5) vs Gavin (16)
- Matt (1) vs Darryan (10)
- Jesse (3) vs Scott (4)
- Emily (15) vs Coop (13)
- Andrew (12) vs Soph (14)

Shoutout this week to our winstreaks: Matt, MatthewR, and Jesse continue their undefeated form with 3/3 wins and Scott has won both of his last 2. Also, Matt with his first 60+ point week this season!
