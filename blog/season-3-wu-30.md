Happy gameweek 30! This week includes a nice international break, so waivers aren't due until Monday, March 31st as 10:15am PDT / 1:15pm EDT! This week's matchups were all over the place, with the most interesting result coming from a 28-all draw between Matt and Emily! Elsewhere, Rebecca took a narrow 25-24 win over Gavin, Dylan snuck past Coop 33-27, and Darryan pulled off the upset against Kevin, 36-19.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 52-20 Jesse
- Emily 28-28 Matt
- Andrew 19-46 Luke
- Soph 4-48 Zach
- Coop 27-33 Dylan
- Scott 12-21 MatthewR
- Darryan 36-19 Kevin
- Gavin 24-25 Rebecca

<br/>

This week sees a bit of movement around the table, including some gaps closing near the top, so let's start there! Yet again MatthewR wins, increasing his lead by 2 to 17 points over Matt, whose draw takes him 4 points clear of Kevin. Kevin now sits just 1 point ahead of Luke and 3 points ahead of me. Zach sits close on my heels with just 1 point separating us. The gap from 6th to 7th grows this week, as Rebecca's win takes her above Gavin on PF, 6 points behind Zach. Coop, Jesse, and Emily remain in the same positions (although Emily goes to just 1 point behind Jesse), while Dylan leapfrogs Scott to go 1 win behind her. Darryan's win closes the gap with Scott to just 1 point.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week was a pretty high scoring one, with just 2 single digit returns on the list!

- Matthew: Anthony Elanga - The Swede continues to be a valuable waiver grab for me with a 16 pointer this week off the back of a brace, clean sheet point, and 3 bonus points in Nottingham Forest's 4-2 win over Ipswich.
- Emily: Jorgen Strand Larsen - Back-to-back braces on this list as the Wolves striker scored both goals in their 2-1 win against Southampton and picked up 13 points for Emily. Also, shoutout to Onana/Haaland for Matt, who both got 7 points in this tie (and the same bps...)
- Luke: Omar Marmoush - The other Egyptian of note in the Premier League sees himself back on the scoresheet for the first time since his hat trick, this time also adding an assist to lead Manchester City to a 2-2 draw against the mighty Brighton and Hove Albion. That amounted to a 12 pointer for Luke.
- Zach: Bruno Fernandes - Due to the blank this week, not much went Soph's way, but it doesn't help that the only person on United who seems to care continues to show up. This time contributing to all 3 goals in their 3-0 win (1g2a), picking up a clean sheet and 3 bonus points in the process for a week-high 17 pointer.
- Dylan: Cristian Romero - Romero returns! And is subbed out before Fulham scores 2, meaning he picked up a clean sheet and bonus point, leading Dylan to a narrow victory and returning 7 total points.
- MatthewR: Calvin Bassey - Somehow, Bassey and De Ligt ended up both on 6 points with the same amount of BPS, so I chose to include Bassey because I thought he's much cooler to put on this list.
- Darryan: Diogo Dalot - The paradoxical wingback delivered the only non-Bruno Fernandes assist in the United game, proving that _sometimes_, _maybe_, he _can_ be good. Anyway, that plus the clean sheet put him on 2 bonus points and a solid 11 pointer for Darryan.
- Rebecca: Tomas Soucek - The Czech did just enough this week, scoring West Ham's only goal in their 1-1 draw against Everton and grabbing all 3 bonus points to lead Rebecca to her 1 point win.

Congratulations to Luke for winning Manager of the Month for March! This super short month saw him win on PF over Rebecca (-12) and MatthewR (-21). See you in April!

In terms of the form table, MatthewR continues his reign on top (despite PF indicators) with 15/15 points earned in the last 5! Rebecca and Luke sit just behind on 12/15 points picked up.
