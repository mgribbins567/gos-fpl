Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 17! Waivers this week are due Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST as we have a full day of games on Saturday! Highlights from this week include Travis's huge 74-47 win against me, Emma picking up a solid victory against Morgs by a score of 42-29, and Alex following up his solid score last week with a 62 point week against Mack's 28. Full results are as follows:

- Travis 74-47 Matthew
- Emma 42-29 Morgs
- ZachA 38-30 Divya
- Chris 36-28 Andrew
- John 47-37 Cara
- Mack 28-62 Alex

<br/>

Looking over at the table, this week's results see my lead at the top cut to just 5 points over John, who maintains his 3 point lead above ZachA. Alex moves up the table to pass Chris on PF, just 1 point off Zach. The duo sit just 2 points above Emma, whose head to head win took her a point above Morgs. Behind Morgs sits Cara at 2 points behind and Mack at 3. Further down the table, Travis cuts the gap with Andrew to just 1 point after his win.

Onto the game changers!

- Travis: Callum Hudson-Odoi - 19 pts - A guy who is evidently a gunner through and through. 2 goals and an assist against Spurs is an Eze statline.
- Emma: Phil Foden - 11 pts - That's 4 double digit returns in a row for Foden as he reverts to his 2023/2024 self with 7 goal contributions in that span… and they have West Ham next.
- ZachA: Trevoh Chalobah - 9 pts - I'm getting so tired of mentioning this guy he might as well be the defensive Haaland with how much he makes these lists.
- Chris: Harry Wilson - 16 pts - Is he… copying Foden? 4 returns in the last 4? Be original buddy.
- John: Bruno Fernandes - 13 pts - Boy does United suck but they have scored 8 goals in the last 2 games and this guy has played a part in 5 of them, so fair play I guess.
- Alex: Marcus Tavernier - 12 pts - Boy does United suck but they let Bournemouth score 4 goals in the last game and this guy played a part in 2 of them, so fair play I guess. What was with that wall placement though?

Halfway through December and Emma remains the only undefeated manager! She is ahead of a slew of managers on 6 points, led by Alex and John!

And unsurprisingly, Emma also sits at the top of the form table with 15/15 points earned in the last 5! John is the lone manager with 12/15 points earned!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge top 4 match between Alex and John! Elsewhere, Mack looks to add another to my losing streak (perhaps by also scoring 74?), Cara takes on Chris, and Morgs faces off against Travis in what could be an interesting matchup. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (1) vs Mack (9)
- Alex (4) vs John (2)
- Cara (8) vs Chris (5)
- Andrew (11) vs ZachA (3)
- Divya (10) vs Emma (6)
- Morgs (7) vs Travis (12)

Shoutouts this week go to Emma for her 6 match unbeaten streak (5W1D)! Also, to Chris, John, Travis, and ZachA for all picking up back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to the knockout stage of the Boxing Day Bash! Yep, that means the group stage has concluded and the elimination rounds have begun! Some interesting results across both groups this week, headlined by a huge 37-29 victory by Cara over Morgs to put Cara into the final playoff spot in Group B! On the other side of things, Travis picked up a 74-28 win against Andrew to secure his own spot in the playoffs! We also saw a 47-47 draw between myself and John, which is interesting. Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew 47-47 John
- Alex 62-30 Divya
- Andrew 28-74 Travis

Group B

- ZachA 38-36 Chris
- Morgs 29-37 Cara
- Mack 28-42 Emma

And with that, we must say goodbye to Divya and Andrew from Group A, along with ZachA and Morgs from Group B. :salute:

Anyway, taking a look at the first round of knockouts, we see the Group A winner Alex take on Cara, with the winner facing off against the winner of Mack and John. And on the other side of the bracket the Group B winner Emma takes on Travis! The winner of that match will meet the winner between me and Chris in the semi finals! Full matchups are as follows:

Top Half

- Alex vs Cara
- Mack vs John

Bottom Half

- Matthew vs Chris
- Emma vs Travis

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): John, Matt, Kevin, Jesse
Fell off: Mack

10 - Alex (NEW) - League B - A solid string of 47+ weeks sees Alex back on the list for the first time since Gameweek 10, narrowly taking this spot from the other managers on the bubble. Who got him here? Big weeks from Tavernier, Van Hecke, Bowen, Sunderland defense and consistency from Gravenberch. Will the streak last? Who knows, but he's got a solid squad with some in form guys.

9 - MatthewR (-3) - League A - Maybe this is an overreaction to a 23 point week and honestly he's probably going to drop 70 on me this week, but the team looks rough when the defense isn't on. Plus with weird minutes for Gordon and Odegaard, along with Kolo Muanu just not really doing anything, there's gotta be a lot of heavy lifting done by Tarkowski/Lacroix. Also, Diouf going to afcon and Kamada being out for 2 months doesn't help.

8 - Dylan (-3) - League A - Maybe less of an overreaction based on recent weeks but he keeps his spot over MatthewR due to the fact that he got lucky enough to win with 29 points. That said... Livramento just got injured, Salah and Dango are off to afcon, and I've heard rumors Szoboszlai is injured as well. Going to need the 2 man midfield of Minteh and Ndoye to carry over the next month.

7 - Scott (+3) - League A - Headed the other way is Scott, who has put up his 3rd 50+ point week in the last 4 weeks off the back of the Bruno Fernandes and Harry Wilson renaissance. That, plus Nketiah getting more minutes and Neto continuing his solid season put him in a great spot.

6 - Luke (-2) - League A - Possibly took too long for Luke to start falling with how many solid weeks are coming from people outside the list, but with a 3rd week in the 30s in a row and one of his top scorers headed to afcon for the month, I've gotta make some room. That said, his team is still good and Palmer is back with a goal against Everton so maybe he'll stave off the drop for a little longer.

5 - Matthew (+3) - League A - Whatever, I'll indulge myself a bit and move up. I've had solid scores the past 5 weeks and have the most in form player in the league in terms of FPL points so whatever. Plus, Wissa is back so yeah, I can totally start leaving hauls on my bench. And 0s in my goalie spot, apparently.

4 - Emma (+3) - League B - The other Foden owner joins me in the top half of the ranking as she has been flying in League B recently (averaging 49.5 across the last 4 weeks). James is somehow surviving, the Manchester City defense has been solid, and apparently Wirtz can get assists now?

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - I'm just sayin', he's fortunate to have had a good week during my audit week, although his recent scores are definitely pretty respectable. Haaland is Haaland, Cherki looks like Foden-lite, and yet Darryan hasn't learned to get points off his bench. It happens (if your bench isn't fully injured).

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Love how I just get to sit back and not think when we get this far in, although my team is looking mighty red these days... Salah/Munoz/Wood are all out and Thiago _vanished_ midweek. Anyway, Rogers has been on fire and at least I played Evanilson.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Not much I can add on here, Saka, Tavernier, Ekitike, and Rogers all had double digit returns this week... and he left 11 points on the bench. Burn got injured though (wishing for a swift recovery for the tall lad) so I guess things get balanced out in sick and twisted ways.

Good luck all!
