Hello everyone and thank you all so much for playing this season! This week is coming from a bench in Retiro Park, Madrid (shoutout Gavin and his fiancee Laura for the Madrid recs) so it will once again be abbreviated! And I'll send out a longer season review with tons of stats once I get home, so stay tuned!

Here's the spreadsheet if you would like to follow along there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQy-Ln_ZJCwgTkUhAVd8kd_8rctbKMSSwlSfGQ4A53I/edit?usp=drivesdk

Anyway, in this final week the highlights included me finishing out the season strong with a 50-42 nail-biting win against Zach, Luke sneaking by Dylan 30-27, MatthewR also pulling out a narrow win 28-25 against Matt, and Scott ending the season on a high with a 30-24 victory against Coop.

The full results are as follows:

- Matthew 50-42 Zach
- Luke 30-27 Dylan
- Matt 25-28 MatthewR
- Jesse 25-33 Kevin
- Emily 25-42 Rebecca
- Andrew 11-51 Gavin
- Soph 43-23 Darryan
- Coop 24-30 Scott

This week our table has been finalized! Movement includes Luke cementing his position in 3rd with his win, Rebecca stealing 7th at the close with her win and Zach's loss, Scott leapfrogging past both Dylan and Jesse to 10th with his victory, and Soph jumping up to 14th above Emily.

And onto our final game changers!

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - 16 - both goals in Bournemouth's win against Leicester feels pretty good.
- Luke: Kieran Tierney - 10 - scored the opener in his final game for Arsenal. Tears in my eyes.
- MatthewR: Tyrick Mitchell - 5 - a pretty nice assist for the Crystal Palace goal. Plus the double guard of honor was kinda sick.
- Kevin: Dominic Solanke - 7 - the first rounder came up clutch for Kevin this week with the only goal drunk Spurs could muster against Brighton.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - 10 - one last spot on this list for the king. (Tied the record for goal involvements in a season too)
- Gavin: Jack Hinshelwood - 15 - this guy hates Spurs as he picked up 2 goals.
- Soph: Levi Colwill - 15 - tapped in the only goal against Nottingham Forest to secure CL qualification. Not a bad day for the Chelsea center back.
- Scott: Ederson - 7 - no goal contribution but he did keep a cs as City did the same as Chelsea.

And finally, congrats to Kevin for winning our final Manager of the Month award! Gavin remained undefeated as well but could not make up the ground on PF!

And to finish off the season, only Kevin kept the streak going with 15/15 points earned. Luke, Gavin, Darryan, and Scott also ended the season with a great record of 12/15 points from the final 5 weeks.

And, since I don't feel like dealing with screenshots while writing this on my notes app (+ tradition) here is a handwritten final table for Season 3.

16. Andrew - 21 - 7-0-31 - 882 PF - 1408 PA - -526 PD

So, once again congrats to MatthewR, our champion! Along with our other "Champions League" contenders Kevin, Luke, and Matt, "Europa League" qualifiers me and Gavin, and "Conference League" qualifier Rebecca.

These don't have much meaning other than for the new coefficient system I'm working on plus discord colors and website profile mentions :)

And on the flip side, Coop, Soph, Emily, and Andrew will receive the dreaded scarlet R for their finishes in the relegation zone.

All things considered, a very competitive season and I'm very excited for the next one!!

Shoutouts this week go to Kevin for finishing the season with a crazy 9 winstreak, Gavin for 4 in a row, and me, Rebecca, and Luke for back to back wins to close out the season.

Shoutouts this season for help with the league, feedback, working on extra things, etc at various points include Emily, Darryan, Kevin, Zach, and Luke. Thank you all for your miscellaneous contributions they are a tremendous help.

And last but not least, here are a couple of forms for you to fill out (I'll also send a separate email with links and some more words in the next ~day)

Also, if you've left feedback on previous forms, thank you! I will be addressing comments and things when I get back (but do fill these out too!)
