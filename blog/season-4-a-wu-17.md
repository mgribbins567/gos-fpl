Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 17! Waivers this week are due Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST as we have a full day of games on Saturday! Highlights from this week include the tragic 4th 3-point or fewer loss for me, 43-46 against Darryan, Dylan taking a narrow 29-25 victory over Coop, and Scott’s big 59-23 upset over MatthewR! Full results are as follows:

- Darryan 46-43 Matthew
- Jesse 44-24 Gavin
- Dylan 29-25 Coop
- Luke 37-66 Zach
- Matt 41-55 Kevin
- MatthewR 23-59 Scott

<br/>

Taking a look over at the table, Zach and Darryan keep their spots at the top as their wins propel them up to 33 points, ahead of Dylan, Luke, and MatthewR, who all sit on 30. Jesse sits just 3 behind them, with Kevin and Scott leapfrogging me to move to 24 points.

Onto the game changers!

- Darryan: Erling Haaland - 13 pts - The robot is back with a brace to extend his golden boot try up to 17 goals in 16 games. His 6th brace and 7th 13+ haul of the season.
- Jesse: Trevoh Chalobah - 9 pts - The Chelsea defender continues his insane form this season with another clean sheet, 13 defcon, and 1 bonus point as the Blues defeat a fellow blue team (Everton) 2-0.
- Dylan: Nordi Mukiele - 8 pts - A huge performance from Sunderland this weekend as Mukiele puts the ball on Woltemade's head to win the derby 1-0.
- Zach: Morgan Rogers - 15 pts - Surely Aston Villa can't keep getting away with this… a tap in and an absolute screamer for Rogers gets him all 3 bonus and leads Zach's army of double digit returns.
- Kevin: Malo Gusto - 18 pts - Someone who actually watched this game can confirm but the stats are telling me it was the Malo Gusto show this weekend, considering he got 1g1a + a clean sheet + all 3 bonus from right back.
- Scott: Harry Wilson - 16 pts - This guy's just been on fire recently, scoring his 3rd goal in the last 4 games and picking up his 3rd and 4th assist in the same time frame. Looking backward, that's 16/8/8/10 points over his last 4.

Halfway through December and Zach is the only undefeated manager! He sits just ahead of a slew of managers on 6 points, led by Scott, Darryan, and Kevin!

In terms of form, unsurprisingly Zach leads that too with 15/15 points earned in the last 5! Scott is the lone manager on 12/15!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge match at the top of the table between Zach and Luke! Elsewhere, we see a Matthew derby between me and MatthewR, Kevin face off against Luke, and Scott look to continue his run of good form against Matt. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (9) vs MatthewR(5)
- Scott (8) vs Matt(10)
- Kevin (7) vs Luke (4)
- Zach (1) vs Dylan (3)
- Coop (11) vs Jesse (6)
- Gavin (12) vs Darryan (2)

Shoutouts this week go to Zach for his 6 winstreak! Also to Kevin and Scott for picking up back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to the knockout stage of the Boxing Day Bash! Yes, that means the group stage has concluded and our final 3 weeks are upon us! Some interesting results across the two groups, most notably being the huge 59-55 Scott win against Kevin in Group B, which secured Darryan's place in the playoffs! Jesse also picked up a key win 44-29 against Dylan, and Coop secured his spot in the knockouts with a 25-23 win over MatthewR. Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Dylan 29-44 Jesse
- MatthewR 23-25 Coop
- Matthew 43-24 Gavin

Group B

- Darryan 46-37 Luke
- Zach 66-41 Matt
- Kevin 55-59 Scott

And with that, the stage is set and we must say goodbye to Dylan and Gavin from Group A, and Kevin and Luke from Group B. Some very surprising results :eyes:

Anyway, turning over to the first round of knockouts, we will see top half matchups between Group A champion MatthewR and Darryan, who will be waiting for the winner of Scott vs Coop. On the other side of the bracket sits the Group B champion Zach, who faces off against Jesse. They will meet the winner of me vs Matt in the semi finals! Full matchups are as follows:

Top Half

- MatthewR vs Darryan
- Scott vs Coop

Bottom Half

- Matthew vs Matt
- Zach vs Jesse

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): John, Matt, Kevin, Jesse
Fell off: Mack

10 - Alex (NEW) - League B - A solid string of 47+ weeks sees Alex back on the list for the first time since Gameweek 10, narrowly taking this spot from the other managers on the bubble. Who got him here? Big weeks from Tavernier, Van Hecke, Bowen, Sunderland defense and consistency from Gravenberch. Will the streak last? Who knows, but he's got a solid squad with some in form guys.

9 - MatthewR (-3) - League A - Maybe this is an overreaction to a 23 point week and honestly he's probably going to drop 70 on me this week, but the team looks rough when the defense isn't on. Plus with weird minutes for Gordon and Odegaard, along with Kolo Muanu just not really doing anything, there's gotta be a lot of heavy lifting done by Tarkowski/Lacroix. Also, Diouf going to afcon and Kamada being out for 2 months doesn't help.

8 - Dylan (-3) - League A - Maybe less of an overreaction based on recent weeks but he keeps his spot over MatthewR due to the fact that he got lucky enough to win with 29 points. That said... Livramento just got injured, Salah and Dango are off to afcon, and I've heard rumors Szoboszlai is injured as well. Going to need the 2 man midfield of Minteh and Ndoye to carry over the next month.

7 - Scott (+3) - League A - Headed the other way is Scott, who has put up his 3rd 50+ point week in the last 4 weeks off the back of the Bruno Fernandes and Harry Wilson renaissance. That, plus Nketiah getting more minutes and Neto continuing his solid season put him in a great spot.

6 - Luke (-2) - League A - Possibly took too long for Luke to start falling with how many solid weeks are coming from people outside the list, but with a 3rd week in the 30s in a row and one of his top scorers headed to afcon for the month, I've gotta make some room. That said, his team is still good and Palmer is back with a goal against Everton so maybe he'll stave off the drop for a little longer.

5 - Matthew (+3) - League A - Whatever, I'll indulge myself a bit and move up. I've had solid scores the past 5 weeks and have the most in form player in the league in terms of FPL points so whatever. Plus, Wissa is back so yeah, I can totally start leaving hauls on my bench. And 0s in my goalie spot, apparently.

4 - Emma (+3) - League B - The other Foden owner joins me in the top half of the ranking as she has been flying in League B recently (averaging 49.5 across the last 4 weeks). James is somehow surviving, the Manchester City defense has been solid, and apparently Wirtz can get assists now?

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - I'm just sayin', he's fortunate to have had a good week during my audit week, although his recent scores are definitely pretty respectable. Haaland is Haaland, Cherki looks like Foden-lite, and yet Darryan hasn't learned to get points off his bench. It happens (if your bench isn't fully injured).

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Love how I just get to sit back and not think when we get this far in, although my team is looking mighty red these days... Salah/Munoz/Wood are all out and Thiago _vanished_ midweek. Anyway, Rogers has been on fire and at least I played Evanilson.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Not much I can add on here, Saka, Tavernier, Ekitike, and Rogers all had double digit returns this week... and he left 11 points on the bench. Burn got injured though (wishing for a swift recovery for the tall lad) so I guess things get balanced out in sick and twisted ways.

Good luck all!
