Happy gameweek 11 and sorry for the late update (won't happen again) (definitely will happen again)! Waivers this week are due on Friday November 8st at 5:30am PDT / 8:30am EDT! This week saw exactly 1 win out of the top 6, with Zach pulling off the 35-32 upset over Matt and Emily taking a convincing 31-21 victory over MatthewR, finally ending his reign of terror since the start of the season! Elsewhere, it's draw city between Jesse and Dylan at 27 and Scott picks up an important 37-32 win against Darryan.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 24-46 Luke
- Matt 32-35 Zach
- Jesse 27-27 Dylan
- Emily 31-21 MatthewR
- Andrew 16-44 Kevin
- Soph 25-41 Rebecca
- Coop 31-42 Gavin
- Scott 37-32 Darryan

This week once again sees widespread changes across the table as the gap between 4th and 12th sits at just 6 points! Starting at the top, MatthewR's loss and Jesse's draw closes the gap to first to just 4 points and inches Jesse up to 2nd by a point over Matt. Luke's win moves him ever so slightly closer to Matt with just a 4 point deficit between 3rd and 4th. Dylan sits just 2 points behind following his draw. On 15 points sits me, newly joined by Gavin and Rebecca. Darryan drops down 1 point behind to 9th, just 2 points ahead of Scott, Zach, and Coop. At the bottom, Kevin and Emily's wins pull them up to 13th and 15th, respectively.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week contains the first situation-based player!

- Luke: Morgan Rogers - In just a disastrous game for Aston Villa away at Spurs (4-1 loss), Morgan Rogers proved his value with a goal and 2 bonus points to contribute 9 points to Luke's 46 total.
- Zach: Antonee Robinson - As the 87th minute between Fulham and Brentford ticked by with Brentford sitting on a 1-0 lead, all looked to be lost for Zach as Bryan Mbeumo was subbed out for the goat Ben Mee (confirming his cs point). Then, in the 92nd minute, Harry Wilson scored an incredible goal for Fulham, having been subbed on just 10 minutes prior. Then, 5 minute later as the final minute of added time ticked through, Antonee Robinson picked up the ball on the left side of the box, putting the ball directly onto the forehead of Harry Wilson who heads home the winner for both Fulham and Zach. Robinson's assist took Zach from a 31-32 deficit up to a 35-32 lead, making him Zach's Game Changer for the week. (Also, shoutout the Bruno Fernandes 10 pointer)
- Dylan: Evanilson - Evanilson once again spearheads Bournemouth's attack with a winning goal in their 2-1 victory over Manchester City, picking up a bonus point to take his fantasy total up to 7 this week and Dylan to a draw. (Shoutout Anthony Gordon's 6 pointer for Jesse in this matchup)
- Emily: Joao Gomes - Gomes lead Emily's team with a man of the match performance in Wolves' 2-all draw against Crystal Palace, including a goal and 3 bonus points for a total of 10 points. Subsequently, this is how much she beat MatthewR by.
- Kevin: Dominic Solanke - Kevin's 1st round draft pick came in clutch this week with a very solid 2 goal, 1 assist, 3 bonus performance at the weekend. That makes up 16 total points for Kevin's team, leading him to the win.
- Rebecca: Callum Hudson-Odoi - As expected, CHO outperforms Mo Salah this week with a goal, clean sheet, and 2 bonus points for 10 points for Rebecca and a solid 3-0 Nottingham Forest win.
- Gavin: Moises Caicedo - A new name on the list! Moises Caicedo who has been pretty solid all things considered for Chelsea this season picked up their lone goal against Manchester United and 2 bonus points, returning 9 points for Gavin.
- Scott: Ola Aina - As Darryan and I's hopes this weeks faded away it was at the hands of Aina, who dropped an absurd 15 points off the back of a wonderful goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus points for a total of 15 off of Scott's bench.

In terms of November Manager of the Month, this first week sees Luke, Kevin, Gavin, and Rebecca all sitting with wins and between 41 and 46 points! This month is a full 4 weeks long, so it's anyone's game!

Looking at the form table we finally have a week without anyone on 5 wins out of 5! Instead, MatthewR and Gavin sit top with 12/15. Luke and the 2 remaining Matt(hew)s sit just behind them!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 3 matchup between Matt and Jesse! They will each be hoping to pick up a win to make up ground on MatthewR. Meanwhile, we have a whole suite of great midtable matches, including me vs Gavin, Rebecca vs Darryan, and Kevin vs Scott.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Gavin (7) vs Matthew (6)
- Rebecca (8) vs Darryan (9)
- Kevin (13) vs Scott (10)
- MatthewR (1) vs Coop (12)
- Dylan (5) vs Soph (14)
- Zach (11) vs Andrew (16)
- Luke (4) vs Emily (15)
- Matt (3) vs Jesse (2)

Shoutout this week to our new winstreak leader: Gavin, with 4 in a row! Just behind him is Rebecca who has 3 wins out of the past 3, Kevin, with 2 wins and a draw, Jesse, with a win and 2 draws(?), and Dylan, with 2 undefeated (1W1D).
