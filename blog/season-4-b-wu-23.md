<br/>

And in a week opposite of League A, nobody has moved on the table! Some notable movement points-wise includes John extending his lead at the top to 5 points, Alex cutting the gap between him and Chris to just a single point, with Zach 2 points behind him, and Cara moving to just 1 point behind Morgs!

Game Changers!

- Andrew: Lisandro Martinez - 8 pts - A comprehensive win for Manchester United against Manchester City this week as 2-0 is honestly flattering. The Argentine picked up a clean sheet and hit defcon in that game.
- Cara: Lewis Hall - 9 pts - Huge week for Lewis Haul (yes I'm going to re-use this pun whenever his name comes up) and for Wolves as they keep their undefeated streak going. Couldn't stop Hall from his clean sheet and 3 bonus though.
- Alex: Malick Thiaw - 9 pts - The German center back made up for his shocking performance last gameweek with the exact same score as Lewis Haul. Nice. Keep it simple.
- Travis: Cole Palmer - 9 pts - Cole found an interesting way to hit 9 points this week: scored a pen, kept a clean sheet, got a yellow card, and then hit defcon? Apparently he tracks back more than anyone thought he did coming into the season. Also, gotta say, it's kinda nice to get to write his name on here again, it's been a while.
- John: Bruno Fernandes - 10 pts - A huge week for United fans as their favorite midfielder assisted, got a clean sheet, hit defcon, and picked up 2 bonus points in the win against City.
- ZachA: Robert Sanchez - 11 pts - The Chelsea defense strat has come back around, this time from a huge 11 points from the goalkeeper. Wild how he can lock in when it's a huge team like Brentford.

60% of the way through January and Alex and John are the only two undefeated managers remaining! They lead a whole bunch of managers on 6 points with 2 gameweeks left!

In terms of form, John keeps it going at the top with his 15/15 points earned! He sits above Alex, Chris, and Mack who all have picked up 12 out of the last 15 available points!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge match between two promotion hopefuls in Chris vs John! Elsewhere, Mack looks to pick up pace on the top half with a match against ZachA, and Morgs takes on Andrew! Full matchups are as follows:

- Divya (11) vs Matthew (2)
- Morgs (8) vs Andrew (10)
- Travis (12) vs Cara (9)
- Emma (6) vs Alex (4)
- ZachA (5) vs Mack (7)
- Chris (3) vs John (1)

Shoutouts this week to Coop for 8 wins in a row! And also to Alex for 4 wins in a row and ZachA for picking up back to back victories!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 4 of the knockout rounds of The League (tm) and our second leg of the quarter final round! A lot of _very_ close matchups across the board and some interesting results as well! All eyes are of course on the Matthew vs Matthew2 match where I defeated myself in the first leg 31-28! Which version of me will win the second leg?? Elsewhere, Andrew took a big lead over Zach by 13 points, Dylan took a similar one against Alex by 12, and Darryan won his first leg against Jesse by 9! All definitely within the realm of possibility for comebacks, so this week should be very interesting! Full results of the first leg are as follows:

- Jesse 27-36 Darryan
- Matthew 28-31 Matthew2
- Zach 21-34 Andrew
- Dylan 49-37 Alex

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Matt, Luke, Andrew, Coop, Dylan
Fell off: None

10 - John (-1) - League B - Last 5: 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W), 42 (W), 32 (W) - A really weird week for scores starts with the League B leader picking up just 32 points (and yet another win). He somehow weathered 2 starting MIDs with 0 points to pick up a win off the best fantasy asset this year, Gabriel, and the best fantasy asset from Manchester United, Bruno Fernandes (surprise surprise). However, the rumors around Mateta loom as he handed in a transfer request, O'Reilly has a Rayan Ait-Nouri looking over his shoulder, and apparently Emi Martinez was selected to be the injury prone goalkeeper of the season.

9 - Alex (+1) - League B - Last 5: 38 (L), 61 (W), 58 (W), 44 (W), 37 (W) - All things considered a good performance from Alex this week. Thiaw making amends, Delap picking up an assist off the bench against Brentford, and Tavernier scoring a penalty. Wait, what's that? Tavernier has a hamstring injury, Bruno G has an ankle injury, and Calafiori is out for a few weeks too? Yikes looks like Kroupi needs to step up and Bowen needs more defcon.

8 - Mack (-1) - League B - Last 5: 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W), 53 (W), 28 (L) - As with most people on this list, Mack also saw a rough return this week with just Milenkovic returning 6+ points. However, Garner did have _29_ defensive contributions, Guehi should be starting this week for Manchester City, and Gyokeres is apparently able to score in Champions League games. If only he could translate that to league performance. Also, Burn is now orange so the tall lad should be back any day now.

7 - Chris (+1) - League B - Last 5: 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W), 36 (W), 35 (L) - Pretty solid week from Chris, especially considering he has a combined _24 points_ on his bench. Maybe he's seen what Darryan can do and wants to follow in his footsteps? Either way, he did not bench Tarkowski, Saliba, and Caicedo, who all returned as expected. If you consider Everton keeping a clean sheet against Aston Villa expected. The rest of his team saw a lot of 2s, but Rice, Wilson, and Watkins surely won't be 2-point merchants every week.

6 - Kevin (-) - League A - Last 5: 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W), 39 (L), 36 (L) - Didn't realize Kevin's team was so Michael Keane reliant. Still an okay week with Thiaw waking up, Caicedo doing Caicedo things, and Joao Pedro finding his monthly form. Interestingly, every time he's scored this season it's been in back to back games. Congrats on your guaranteed FWD goal this week! Anyway, Liverpool looks like sometimes they want to defend and DCL is still in the form of his life so expecting some big weeks from him upcoming. Oh, Leeds plays Everton and Arsenal next, oof.

5 - Zach (-2) - League A - Last 5: 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L), 40(L), 21 (L) - Reactionary? Maybe. But the second 20-pointer in the last 5 and a big Tavernier injury does not inspire much confidence. Plus, Saka and Trossard both rested in the prem for a Champions League match that didn't actually really matter was strange. And, what happened to Sesko? Rough times with UCL rotation and Rogers going 5 weeks with just a single assist to his name.

4 - Matthew (-) - League A - Last 5: 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L), 40 (W), 28 (W) - Hey a win's a win. Even though my stupid ass benched Murillo against Arsenal, Pope and Truffert did enough to almost get me 30 points. And really I should be thanking Hurzeler for putting on Minteh so that Truffert had the opportunity to defend someone. Maybe next week someone on my team will do something.

3 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - Last 5: 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W), 30 (L), 37 (W) - His prize for moving into the top 2 in League A is top 3 in the power rankings, off the back of blue team supremacy: Sanchez, Tarkowski, and Enzo being the only players to return this week. But hey 11 points from an error prone Chelsea keeper, 8 from the defcon king himself, and an assist from the only person on Chelsea to be able to get goals and assists is all you need these days. And Watkins has only gone 2 games without scoring, surely he won't blank for 7 straight weeks again.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Last 5: 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W), 60 (W), 31 (L) - I mean, I really shouldn't have benched Murillo on both of my teams. On the other hand my other defenders did pretty well? The remainder of them didn't though, with Anderson being the only useful player out there. But hey I have Salah back, and even more importantly Munoz is returning to a dumpster fire of a Crystal Palace team.

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D), 58 (W), 36 (L) - Another week where a slightly different bench choice would've resulted in a Darryan win (he lost by 1 point and had a 3 and 4 on the bench). I'm sure he'll be fine though, Haaland should get a rest soon which will only help him in the long run, Romero is the only player who can score goals on Spurs, and double Arsenal defence can't be beat. But also, 1 goal in the last 5 weeks from the robot is _rough_.

Good luck all!
