Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 19! Waivers this week were due this morning (probably, I'm currently writing this on an airplane so I honestly am not sure when this will be sent out) since there are games tomorrow! Highlights from this week include a narrow 31-29 win by Coop over Matt, a high scoring 56-42 win by Kevin over Scott, a new high of 77 points from MatthewR against Zach's 37, and Gavin's 2nd win of the season: a 31-27 victory over Luke! Full results are as follows:

- Jesse 35-39 Matthew
- Dylan 15-40 Darryan
- Luke 27-31 Gavin
- Matt 29-31 Coop
- MatthewR 77-37 Zach
- Scott 42-56 Kevin

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, we see an outright leader in 1st for the first time in who knows how long, as Darryan's win takes him 3 points ahead of Zach! Zach keeps himself 3 points ahead of a new face in the top 3: MatthewR, whose head to head win over Zach moved him out of the pack. And that pack on 30 points is big: Kevin, Jesse, Dylan, and Luke all make that list, just 3 points ahead of me. Then, Scott, Matt, and Coop all see 3 point gaps ahead of them.

Onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - 9 pts - He's back with goals in back to back to back games, yet Bournemouth lost this one 4-1 to Brentford. How curious. Got him 2 bonus points though.
- Darryan: Rayan Cherki - 13 pts - Another solid game from Cherki rescuing Manchester City from Dyche-ball with a goal and an assist if I remember correctly.
- Gavin: Florian Wirtz - 10 pts - Welcome back to the list Gavin! Last time it was Grealish, this time the German midfielder scored 10 points to earn 3 in the league.
- Coop: Jake O'Brien - 6 pts - Whoever watched this game is a sicko and really should not be allowed to use a television remote. You have 5 games on at once and end up on the 0-0 Everton vs Burnley game? Okay buddy.
- MatthewR: Kevin Schade - 20 pts - A hat trick for another German lad on the list as Bournemouth just does not know how to defend away from home. It's awesome I called the 70 pointer 1 week late.
- Kevin: Ryan Gravenberch - 11 pts - Another goal and a 12th defcon at the dearth to secure a +2 and bonus for the Liverpool defensive midfielder.

Going into the final gameweek of December, we have a 3 team tie for 1st in the Manager of the Month race! Zach has a slight lead on PF, with Darryan and Kevin barely behind!

The form table is, of course, the same as the Manager of the Month table this week. So I won't write anything else about it. Here it is though:

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a matchup between two in form teams in Kevin vs MatthewR! Elsewhere, I take on Scott and Jesse faces off against Darryan in what should be a couple of interesting matchups. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (8) vs Scott (9)
- Kevin (4) vs MatthewR (3)
- Zach (2) vs Matt (10)
- Coop (11) vs Luke (7)
- Gavin (12) vs Dylan (6)
- Darryan (1) vs Jesse (5)

Shoutouts this week go to Kevin for his 4 winstreak! Also to Darryan for 3 wins in a row and myself for picking up back to back wins!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Cara, Chris, Alex, Mack, Matt
Fell off: Matt

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 52 (W), 51 (W), 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W) - A huge week for Chris as he continues his good form off the back of the legend Ollie Watkins himself. And that's with a solid supporting cast (of which he saw _a lot_ of returns this week) between defcon beat Tarkowski (who apparently did play a match this week), the only good Spurs defender, and midfielders including the 2nd highest scorer (Rice), defcon beast Xhaka, and this year's best RW (Wilson).

9 - Scott (-1) - League A - Last 5: 25 (L), 56 (W), 59 (W), 28 (L), 42 (L) - Honestly not a bad performance this week, but considering 17 points are from Patrick Dorgu I worry about the coming few as Bruno Fernandes recovers, Amad made the knockouts at afcon, and Eze has vanished into thin air. That said, Neto and Wilson have been solid, Richarlison could have had 2 goals if the offside rule didn't exist, and Everton and Liverpool have a pretty solid run of games (defensively).

8 - John (-2) - League B - Last 5: 36 (L), 74 (W), 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W) - The answer is yes, 31 points is enough to keep you on the power rankings this week. It isn't every gameweek you see someone roll out the 523 so my presumption is with Szoboszlai unflagged and Grealish/KDH returning soonish(?), the 4 points midfield from just Anton Stach is a temporary thing. Also, Raul and DCL especially have been cooking and Gabriel is back, so surely the #2 team in League B will be just fine.

7 - Emma (-2) - League B - Last 5: 50 (W), 57 (W), 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W) - Normally I wouldn't drop someone too many spots for a 37 point week, so this one is more about other managers performing well rather than Emma doing poorly. After all, Wirtz figured out that scoring will do a hell of a lot better than 'passing the eye test' to silence the haters, Tottenham kept a clean sheet (away from home, of course), and Reece James has maybe the longest point breakdown list I've ever seen for just a 6 pointer.

6 - Kevin (+3) - League A - Last 5: 33 (L), 44 (W), 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W) - Kevin's team has once again figured out what it's like to score points, with Gravenberch, Keane, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin leading his charge up the table. Imagine naming the 3 of them at the beginning of the season as key players in week 19.

5 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - Last 5: 52 (W), 44 (W), 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W) - Of course I'm obligated to let MatthewR ride the wave of the highest score of the season up a couple spots. Yeah, it's from a Schade 20 pointer, a first goal of the season from Odegaard, a 32 minute appearance from Watkins that resulted in a brace, and (somehow least surprisingly of the 4) a 11 point week from Van de Ven. Maybe next week he'll start Dubravka though to try for the 85 pointer.

4 - Matthew (-) - League A - Last 5: 64 (W), 36 (L), 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W) - My team's still trucking away around 40, this time from yet another Semenyo goal (while he remains at Bournemouth), Tielemans nearly setting the 12 defcon land speed record (and also getting an assist), and Antonee Robinson being the prince that was promised when I drafted him. If only I could win some close matchups (maybe Gakpo could help with that?).

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 54 (W), 38 (L), 46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W) - Somehow Darryan survives an inexplicable triple 0 pointer from his defenders from 0 flagged players, plus a Rutter own goal. I guess Cherki, Xhaka, and Raul Jiminez are pretty good. And that's with Haaland returning a solid 2 points.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Last 5: 52 (W), 33 (L), 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L) - Certainly an off week, but that's how things go and based on the rest of this season, I should score 42+ this week. Praying Dango comes back soon so Thiago can finally score some pens again.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 53 (W), 61 (W), 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L) - This guy also has Rogers and Kerkez so the scores are looking _pretty_ similar. The main difference being he got his points from Gvardiol, Saka, and Ekitike and I got mine from _Mykolenko, Leno, and Thiago_. Wonder who will be better off in the long run?

Good luck all!
