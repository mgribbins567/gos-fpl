Happy gameweek 26! Yet another quick turnaround with waivers again due tomorrow at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST! This week saw some close matchups and some blowouts, led by Coop's come from behind 49-45 victory over Gavin! Elsewhere, Jesse took a narrow 33-31 win against Dylan, Matt defeated Zach 40-32, and Rebecca beat Soph in yet another high scoring matchup, 61-42.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 33-54 Luke
- Matt 40-32 Zach
- Jesse 33-31 Dylan
- Emily 18-28 MatthewR
- Andrew 11-34 Kevin
- Soph 42-61 Rebecca
- Coop 49-45 Gavin
- Scott 51-33 Darryan

<br/>

Yet again we see very little movement on the table, with just Luke and I exchanging places from 4th to 5th. As usual, the top 3 all won, and due to my loss, the gap from 3rd to 4th increases to 4 points. I still sit 1 point above Zach and 4 ahead of Gavin. Just behind him sits the group of Jesse/Rebecca/Coop, whose wins this week narrowed the gap to just 1/3/3 points, respectively, and widened the gap down to Emily to 6 points. Scott's win also closes the gap behind Dylan and Soph to just 1 point.

Now onto the Game Changers! Another week of a few familiar faces and a couple new ones!

- Luke: Omar Marmoush - The Marmoush for VVD trade pays off early in favor of the newly transferred Egyptian as he picks up a hat trick en route to Manchester City's 4-0 win over Newcastle. In total, that's 17 points for the cityzen.
- Matt: Luis Diaz - Very little work done in his second match of the week (1 point), but the remainder of his 13 points came off the back of a goal, assist, and 2 bonus points in Liverpool's 2-1 win against Wolves.
- Jesse: Youri Tielemans - The Belgian provided the opposite experience to Luis Diaz, picking up a goal and 3 bonus points in Villa's 2-2 draw against Liverpool and only the 2 minutes played points in his first match, for a total of 12 and a narrow victory for Jesse.
- MatthewR: Calvin Bassey - A surprising name on this list and for a surprising reason: a goal! The central defender picked up his 2nd ever premier league goal as Fulham pull off a surprise win against Nottingham Forest 2-1, for 8 fantasy points and a week high for MatthewR.
- Kevin: Bart Verbruggen - A big week for keepers getting assists as Bart supplied a beautiful ball into Mitoma whose PHD came in handy to bring it down and score. That, along with the clean sheet and bonus point, supplied 10 points to Kevin this week.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - I mean, what can you say. This guy is absolutely on one, getting his 24th goal and 15th assist on the season (2g1a and 3 total bonus points this week). He has now beaten his FPL total for every other season _except for his record breaking one_, which he'll almost definitely also beat. 20 pointer.
- Coop: Chris Wood - The Kiwi keeps scoring as he notches his 18th goal of the campaign and picks up 3 bonus points in Forest's loss to Fulham. What an insane season this guy is having.
- Scott: Ederson - Our second keeper who got an assist this week and kept a clean sheet! Unlike Bart though, the Brazilian nabbed 2 bonus instead of 1 for an 11 pointer for Scott.

Halfway through February and Rebecca has gained a heavy PF lead with 145 off the back of Salah's 49 points. Luke, Kevin, and MatthewR are the other undefeated teams in case she drops any points in these last 2 gameweeks.

In terms of the form table, Kevin once again sits on top with 15/15 points earned. He is followed by Rebecca, Gavin, and Matt who have picked up 12/15 over the past 5!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by me vs Gavin! Elsewhere, we'll see a number of matchups between teams in similar PF form, including MatthewR vs Coop, Kevin vs Scott, and Dylan vs Soph!

Full matchups are as follows:

- Gavin (7) vs Matthew (5)
- Rebecca (9) vs Darryan (12)
- Kevin (3) vs Scott (15)
- MatthewR (1) vs Coop (10)
- Dylan (13) vs Soph (14)
- Zach (6) vs Andrew (16)
- Luke (4) vs Emily (11)
- Matt (2) vs Jesse (8)

Shoutout this week to Kevin for his 9 winstreak! Also shoutouts to Rebecca for 4 in a row, Luke for 3, and MatthewR for back to back victories!

Fun to note as well this week, this is the first time since Gameweek 11 that MatthewR does not have the most points for: Matt has just passed him 1020 vs 1015!
