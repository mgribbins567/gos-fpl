Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 16! Waivers this week are due Friday morning at 5:30am PST / 8:30am EST! Highlights from this week include some high scoring matchups such as the 55-47 ZachA victory over Alex, the 57-43 Emma win against Cara, and John's huge 74 pointer against my 33. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 33-74 John
- Mack 34-51 Chris
- Alex 47-55 ZachA
- Cara 43-57 Emma
- Andrew 18-40 Travis
- Divya 25-33 Morgs

<br/>

Take a look at the table, John's head to head win against me cuts my lead to 8! He maintains a 3 point gap above ZachA, who's win keeps him at pace over the group on 24: Chris, Alex, and Morgs. Emma and Cara sit just 2 points behind them, followed closely by Mack just 1 point off.

Game changers!

- John: Bruno Fernandes - 18 pts - Has Amorim considered playing Wolves every week to save his job? Is he stupid?
- Chris: James Tarkowski - 9 pts - The defcon beast himself puts up 17 defcon as Everton defcons all over Nottingham Forest 3-0.
- ZachA: Rayan Cherki - 12 pts - Thank god Foden scored that rabona assist because holyyy this guy is a baller.
- Emma: Ruben Dias - 14 pts - Kinda rude to have more points than the guy who had a rabona assist but I guess a center back with a goal and clean sheet is pretty good. I guess it helps the goal was a screamer.
- Travis: Josko Gvardiol - 12 pts - It's center back scoring goals city over here. Too bad he got a yellow and only 1 bonus instead of 2 or they could have both had 14.
- Morgs: Michael Keane - 9 pts - Fitting that we end with another Everton center back who also got a lot of defcon (14). What was Nottingham Forest doing, just lobbing it up for header practice?

One third of the way through December and Emma is the only manager with 6 points! All of the league except for Andrew is on 3 points (sorry Andrew), so it's gonna be a close one.

In terms of form, Emma sits atop the table with 13 points out of the last 15 earned! She sits just ahead of myself on 12.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a match between two teams looking to pick up some form in Mack and Alex! Elsewhere, Morgs looks to defend her league position against a surging Emma and John takes on Cara! Full matchups are as follows:

- Travis (12) vs Matthew (1)
- Emma (7) vs Morgs (6)
- ZachA (3) vs Divya (10)
- Chris (4) vs Andrew (11)
- John (2) vs Cara (8)
- Mack (9) vs Alex (5)

Shoutout this week to Emma for going 5 matches unbeaten (4W1D)!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to week 5 and the final week of the Group Stage in the Boxing Day Bash! Some interesting results in Group B especially this week, with Emma taking a crazy 57-55 victory over ZachA and Mack defeating Morgs by a score of 34-33! Group A's highlight was Alex's solid 47-33 win against me. Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew 33-47 Alex
- John 74-40 Travis
- Andrew 18-25 Divya

These results see a 3-way race at the top of Group A for 1st between myself (9 pts), Alex (9 pts), and John (7 pts)! Divya is also in a solid spot with 6 points and a 27 PF lead over Travis who is on 3 points. Unfortunately, Andrew has been eliminated and will look to play spoiler this week.

Group B

- ZachA 55-57 Emma
- Chris 51-43 Cara
- Morgs 33-34 Mack

The opposite group sees a close race at the top as well! This time between two undefeated teams in Mack and Emma, who are both on 12 points. Chris looks to be in a solid spot on 6 points, with Morgs and Cara potentially battling it out for that final knockout stage slot. And surprisingly, since Morgs and Cara will play each other this week, ZachA has been eliminated (even if he wins this week).

That means there are some huge matchups this week, headlined by Emma vs Mack in Group B to decide who will be the #1 seed! And, as mentioned before, Morgs and Cara are in a win-and-in situation! Over in Group A, I face off against John with the ability to secure the top spot with a win and Alex takes on Divya (and hopes for my downfall). Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew vs John
- Alex vs Divya
- Andrew vs Travis

Group B

- ZachA vs Chris
- Morgs vs Cara
- Mack vs Emma

# Power Rankings

A prenote before my rankings: this week was _weird_ for scores, so I'm putting a lot of managers on the bubble to see if this week is _less weird_ for scores. A big factor in making the power rankings is consistency, so I want to see if the managers at the top of the list continue to have off-weeks, or if it was just, as I said, a _weird_ week.

On the bubble (in no order): John, ZachA, Kevin, Matt, Jesse, Chris, Alex
Fell off: None

10 - Scott (-) - League A - A solid bounce back from Scott off the back of a huge Bruno Fernandes week and De Cuyper being the lucky defender subbed off before his team conceded. That said, Eze's minutes are getting weird, Richarlison and Flemming aren't a pair I would consider consistent, and also maybe a re-arranging of the bench is needed (23 points).

9 - Mack (-2) - League B - Mack has joined me in cursing Evanilson's name as he continues to squander Semenyo's efforts. She does have a well balanced squad in my opinion, especially with Gyokeres back from injury and going up against... Wolves this week. Plus, she has 4 defcon getters on her backline and a couple in midfield to support the aforementioned Ghanaian, Eze, and the other giant on Newcastle.

8 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Yeah why not, let's overreact on my own squad. Half my guys are injured (again) (the other half), Palhinha apparently doesn't start anymore, and guess what Munoz needs surgery. Maybe someone should warn Wissa before he gets too many minutes that he's risking his life.

7 - Emma (+2) - League B - 3 50 pointers in a row for Emma sees her shoot up the rankings. Huge weeks for Manchester City players as Foden picks up his 3rd double digit haul in a row, Trossard continues his great form, and Ruben Dias does Kompany cosplays? She's also got White who is deputizing for an injured Arsenal backline and Reece James who is somehow still uninjured.

6 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - Another big week for the DEF team as this time he gets the :sanchez: 10 pointer and is that another clean sheet due to a sub I see? Anyway, 10 points from his MIDs and FWDs and 34 from the rest of his team is... sustainable. Although maybe leaving the Gordon 10 pointer on the bench was a flex?

5 - Dylan (-2) - League A - It starts getting a bit dicey in the top 5 as Dylan finds himself in ticky tack score hell with only Szoboszlai doing much. That on top of the genuinely real chance that Salah leaves Liverpool in January puts some question marks on if the run of every-other-week 30 pointers will end. That said, he's got Welbeck.

4 - Luke (-) - League A - A slightly better but still under average week from Luke as I look at his team and see a whole lot of red and yellow. I don't think they're too bad (e.g. Fofana should be back I think). He's going to need the Palmer carry to kick in any minute now though, especially with Ndiaye headed to afcon in what 2 gameweeks.

3 - Darryan (+2) - League A - Really difficult to rank these three but I think Darryan just edges it with Saliba coming back from injury (possibly) soon, Calafiori and Timber back, and Cherki playing out of his mind. If only Evanilson had feet and a brain.

2 - Matthew2 (-1) - League B - Suffering from a Salah-shaped hole and suddenly Munoz out for god knows how long. Still, Rogers has looked good, Kudus is maybe the only player on Spurs these days, and Anderson can't stop tackling, so I think I'll be just fine.

1 - Zach (+1) - League A - Fair is fair, a 61 point week will put you on top, even if it's from a Gvardiol 12 pointer and Ekitike scoring his first goal(s) since gameweek 5. Still, there's no injury crisis and 5 mostly solid midfielders so in Tavernier/Rogers/Wieffer/Saka/Trossard and double Manchester City defense (with however much that is worth..)

Good luck all!
