Hello all! Due to the powers that be over at Fantasy Premier League HQ, the whole draft process is extremely buggy and kinda messed up. In response to that, I am taking this opportunity to do something that I have always wanted to do with this league - an offline draft!

A note for League B - I don't know everyone super well, so if you can't be in a Google Meet call (at least listening), just let me know and if there are enough people who this would inconvenience then we can try using the in-game draft system.

### What is an offline draft?

An **offline draft** is a draft that takes place _not_ on the site that the game is played on. Generally, it involves a bunch of people huddled around a whiteboard for a few hours drinking beers and making jokes until every team is chosen (or at least that's how I imagine it to be).

### How will this work for our league?

The draft will start at the advertised time (11am PDT for A, 3pm PDT for B), where everyone will join a Google Meet room at the link (again, only available in Discord and email).

Normal draft rules will apply, including the 120 seconds timer.

Instead of selecting players on the app, you will message me the player you would like to draft and I will announce it.

The player list, including who has been selected and who is available, can be found here: <u>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-bRzr2DK7xBpfOWBY_YkSzas0THSuc1P05Bl8B924M0/edit?usp=sharing</u>. I recommend making a copy of this sheet on Sunday (after I update it for the final time) so that you can sort players differently during the draft to make your choice. The 'Teams' tab will also be updated during the draft so that you can check who you have selected and what position they are.

### What if I run out of time, miss the draft, or have to leave early?

There are two options in these cases:

1. Prepare a watchlist (which should be sent to me by Sunday), in which case I will announce the next ranked available player on your behalf.
2. The next highest draft rank player will be selected for you (meeting position requirements, etc.)

Though, you should be aware that the "draft rank" used in my spreadsheet is based on Price, then Total Points last season. This means that players new to the league are ranked slightly differently than the official PL draft rank (they use some sort of expected points too, but I think I deleted that column).

### Okay, we've selected our players, how do we get them in the game?

After the draft, everyone will then **add only their 15 players to their in-game watchlist**. Then, I will run the draft and it will _automatically_ select every team. The watchlist is accessed by going to the "Draft Room" tab. Click "Watch" to add your players.

**Please** do not put any players who you did not pick during the draft on your watchlist. It will just create more work on my end, so just don't do it.

### Final Thoughts / Reminders

Reminder for those in the B League - join the league on the site! It helps me keep track of who is actually in and it really helps me mentally keep tabs when people are in there.

And reminder for those in A League - contribution to the prize pool is **mandatory**, so be sure to send that to me! B Leaguers, feel free to contribute to your prize pool as well but it is not mandatory!

Currently, the prize pool for League A is at $369, and League B is at $140!

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!
