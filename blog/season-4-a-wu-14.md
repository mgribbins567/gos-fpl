A quick heads up - Zach unintentionally dropped Dan Burn, so in order to fix this I'm requesting nobody pick him up so he can fix it next week :) thanks!

Hello everyone and welcome to Gameweek 14! This week had a quick turnaround since we have games tomorrow, so waivers were due this morning and free agency is open! Highlights from this week include a harrowing 47-45 win by me over Luke, along with two big upsets in Matt defeating Dylan 48-34 and Scott beating Darryan 58-26! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 47-45 Luke
- Matt 48-34 Dylan
- MatthewR 25-41 Jesse
- Scott 58-26 Darryan
- Kevin 45-20 Gavin
- Zach 36-26 Coop

<br/>

Taking a look over at the table, the top gets congested as all of the top 4 lost this week! Darryan and Luke stay on top with 27 points, and Zach and Jesse join Dylan and MatthewR on 24 points. Myself, Kevin, and Scott sit 6 points back of that group. Just a bit further down, Matt leapfrogs Coop into 10th, just 3 points off the group on 18 points.

Time for game changers!

- Matthew: Phil Foden - 15 pts - Bookended Manchester City barely defeating Leeds with a goal in the 1st and 91st minutes. POTY Phil is back? :copium:
- Matt: Ezri Konsa - 8 pts - Aston Villa continues their hot and cold defensive streak as they pick up their 3rd clean sheet in the last 5 weeks against Wolves, earning Konsa 2 whole bonus points against the worst team in the league.
- Jesse: Trevoh Chalobah - 9 pts - Somehow the Chelsea center back has 4 returns in his last 4 (and 5 in his last 6) as he netted his 3rd goal of the season this week against Arsenal in their 1-1 draw. Chelsea defense good? Never thought I'd see the day.
- Scott: Maxim De Cuyper - 15 pts - Picking up the mantle from Eze last week is the Belgian fullback who scored, kept a clean sheet, and earned all 3 bonus points against Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 win.
- Kevin: Malick Thiaw - 16 pts - Didn't watch the game but the center back scored 2 goals against Everton? Did he absorb Michael Keane's essence from across the pitch? Anyway 442 with Woltemade and Thiaw up top who says no
- Zach: Pau Torres - 6 pts - Big week for Villa defenseman as the center back pairing made this list. Yeah not much more to say here.

Congrats to Scott for winning November Manager of the Month as the only undefeated manager!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): MatthewR, Kevin, Matt
Fell off: Morgs

10 - John (-) - League B - Another pretty decent week from John keeps him on this list while he ascends to 2nd in League B. Fernandes seems to be picking up consistent points now, Mateta proves that despite his inconsistencies he _can_ score a pen sometimes, and Paqueta is back to his old ways. Can't teach an old dog new tricks I suppose.

9 - Scott (NEW) - League A - A big week from Scott (58 pts) forces my hand as I have deja vu in mentioning Bruno Fernandes. Anyway, recent weeks have seen some incredible pop offs from this team: De Cuyper this week (and Bruno, and Wilson), Eze last, Neto the week before that leading the team.

8 - ZachA (-1) - League B - The epic highs and lows of Chelsea + Newcastle football. Up when they get clean sheets, down when they don't. Anyway, with the Sarr injury Zach's team is looking _awfully_ red, plus he's got Mbeumo off to afcon shortly. Chalobah is killing it though.

7 - Mack (+1) - League B - She can't buy a league win to save her life (went against the highest score in League B this week), but she's got consistent point-getters in Andersen, Collins, Guehi (except against United apparently), Casemiro, and Wieffer, if only Semenyo didn't have Evanilson ahead of him... Anyway, she's got the 2 tallest guys in the Premier League so surely her bad luck won't go on much longer.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - Look at me not even overreacting to my team somehow winning a close match (!!) Anyway my guys keep trying to sabotage me by getting randomly injured (Murillo...) or being subbed off at 59' (Palhinha...) or being subbed on 11 defcon (Tielemans...) but I'm not salty because turns out getting just two more PF can in fact backfire.

5 - Darryan (-1) - League A - Haaland hasn't scored in **two** whole games and thus Darryan must slip a little further down the (power ranking) ladder. Even still, he's got a _lot_ of guys with 4 or 5 points. If only Arsenal could've kept a clean sheet against 10 man Chelsea.

4 - Zach (+1) - League A - 4th in the league and 4th in the rankings off the back of a solid 5 at the back performance. Again a lot of 4 and 5s but Saka and Rogers definitely are high ceiling players and that's 2 starting City defenders (for now). Just needs to figure out that FWD spot...

3 - Dylan (-1) - League A - The 2nd place spot is a fickle one as Dylan's performance this week was heavily influenced by Dango Unchained. Plus, who knows if the Salah benching is good or bad for the 8 time 200+ point scorer. Only time will tell I guess.

2 - Luke (+1) - League A - Let's just say it's not easy to beat me by single digit points where we're both in the 40s twice. Jokes aside another solid week from Luke with Gakpo saving his countryman's job, Thiago continuing to kill it, and a Woltemade goal disguising the array of 1 pointers across his board. Also Palmer saw the bench for the first time in something like 8 weeks.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - And somehow my teams are intrinsically linked, scoring the same number of points for the 2nd time this season. Kudus looks like maybe the only bright spot on Spurs, Anderson's 4+ point streak continues to 4 weeks, and Evanilson could have done a lot better than 5 points. Plus, who knows if the Salah benching is good or bad for the 8 time 200+ point scorer. Only time will tell I guess.

Good luck all!
