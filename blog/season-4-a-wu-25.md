Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 25! Waivers this week were due this morning at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST so free agency is open! Another week of close matches, headlined by Matt's narrow 41-40 win over Dylan! Elsewhere, Luke defeated me by the same margin at 35-34, and Zach beat Coop in a close 40-37 match, and Kevin took home all 3 points in a high scoring matchup against Gavin, 47-41! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 34-35 Luke
- Matt 41-40 Dylan
- MatthewR 27-45 Jesse
- Scott 26-61 Darryan
- Kevin 47-41 Gavin
- Zach 40-37 Coop

<br/>

Over on the league table, Darryan's win sees him extend his lead at the top to 4 points over Zach, who went above MatthewR on PF this week! Matthew sits 6 points above me, Dylan, and Jesse, who are just one win ahead on Kevin and Luke in this congested midtable. Matt keeps pace just 2 points behind, extending his gap over Scott and Coop to 4 points.

Game Changers! Btw I didn't watch the games this week so these may be a little bereft of detail.

- Luke: Marcos Senesi - 8 pts - The defcon beast himself picks up his 6th clean sheet and 19th week of hitting defcon. Geez dude.
- Matt: Martin Zubimendi - 10 pts - Goalscoring 6 why not? His _4th_ goal of the season, plus a clean sheet, plus 2 bonus points.
- Jesse: Casemiro - 13 pts - He was _this_ close to getting maximum modifiers: goal, assist, clean sheet, yellow card, and bonus. He's just missing own goal and defcon? maybe next week.
- Darryan: Caoimhin Kelleher - 10 pts - What a pickup Kelleher has been for Darryan (shoutout me for dropping him), with his 3rd double digit week of the season, this time with a clean sheet and 5 saves (plus 3 bonus) against Aston Villa.
- Kevin: Joao Pedro - 10 pts - Wait wait wait wait, he can't do that? 3 goals in 3 games (with 2 assists sprinkled in), this time against West Ham, who threw away a 2-0 lead. Nice one guys.
- Zach: Hugo Ekitike - 13 pts - The Frenchman rescued Zach's week with 2 goals against Newcastle for his first goals since week 17 (he did miss 2 games in the middle there). Liverpool kinda clicking on attack other than Gakpo -,-.

Congratulations to Matt for winning January Manager of the Month! With an impressive 13 points earned across this month!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be a fascinating one between Matt and MatthewR! Elsewhere, Dylan has a big matchup against Kevin, Jesse and Zach face off, and Darryan takes on an in-form team in Coop! Full matchups are as follows:

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Matt, Alex
Fell off: None
On a tear but I can't find a place on the list for him right now: ZachA

10 - Dylan (-) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 29 (L), 49 (W), 48 (L), 40 (L) - Another tough loss this week for Dylan as this time his decision to bench Dango is what did him in. Some solid showings though with Szoboszlai, Salah, and Janelt all picking up 4/5 pointers and Mukiele continuing his crazy 3 assists in a row run. That means the last time he had less than 3 points in a week was gameweek 15, _9_ weeks ago (and he only had 3 points once in that timeframe). He's almost better than Gabriel at this point.

9 - Kevin (-1) - League A - Last 5: 45 (W), 39 (L), 36 (L), 27 (L), 47 (W) - Sorry Kevin had to do some leveling of the Power Rankings this week which meant even with a 47 you got a down arrow. That said, very solid week, with Joao Pedro breaking his curse, Gyokeres breaking his curse, and MGW being an absolute beast over the last 5 weeks and scoring yet again. Too bad about the random Ayari injury and ineffective defensive line (other than Konate on the bench). Is Konate good again? Or did he just learn how to score somehow.

8 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 31 (W), 42 (W), 32 (W), 43 (L), 43 (L) - I think he said so himself but he _really_ should try not scoring 43 points. That's back to back losses with the same score which was enough for him to drop to 2nd in League B. If he can figure out this whole luck thing though I think he'll be fine, as Bruno Fernandes is looking like possibly the best MID to own in the game, Gabriel is almost definitely the best DEF, and DCL is the best player period. If only he could stem the injury crisis that has been plaguing his Leeds and Everton players.

7 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 28 (L), 40(L), 21 (L), 35 (W), 40 (W) - Welp, the Ekitike drought was not long lasting as he scored 2 against Newcastle and carried the remainder of Zach's team to victory. Sesko helped, although I'm not really sure how this guy scores 2 goals, then has _25_ minutes in the next 3 matches. Carrick at the wheel I guess. You gotta respect the 5-2-3 though considering Saka, Onana, and Tavernier are all MIA.

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Last 5: 30 (L), 40 (W), 28 (W), 38 (W), 34 (L) - Okay, maybe I am cooked. For some reason I benched Gakpo at the last second and lost by 1 instead of scraping by with another lucky win. My only saving grace this week was Semenyo doing Semenyo things and Solanke scoring a Guehi own goal and a crazy scorpion kick. That's my 2nd round pick!! Hoping and asking an etsy witch to get Foden some starts (and some goals) soon.

5 - MatthewR (-2) - League A - Last 5: 51 (W), 30 (L), 37 (W), 49 (W), 27 (L) - Maybe this guy's also cooked. Schade red card, Odegaard flagged, Gordon injured, maybe Watkins will be back this weekend? But hey Enzo Fernandez is somehow probably the best player on Chelsea having picked up 4 goals and an assist in the last 6 games. Havertz is back though :kai:

4 - Chris (+1) - League B - Last 5: 63 (W), 36 (W), 35 (L), 52 (W), 39 (L) - An unfortunate loss with 39 points off the back of the double Bournemouth clean sheet and now much else going on. _Is Barry good?_ _Is Wilson the goat?_ _Will Watkins be back this weekend?_ So many questions and so few answers.

3 - Mack (+3) - League B - Last 5: 41 (W), 53 (W), 28 (L), 45 (L), 41 (W) - A big jump up the board for Mack as I continue doing some leveling and acknowledge her impressive record of having only 1 gameweek less than 41 in the last 8 weeks (incoming jinx). Point coming from Semenyo, Casemiro, and Garner all being weirdly consistent, on top of defcon beasts such as Milenkovic, Collins, Guehi, and Andersen. Plus sometimes Gyokeres can score. Sometimes. Oh and a huge Strand Larsen move to Crystal Palace could see him being the starting striker for Munoz to cross the ball to.

2 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 43 (D), 58 (W), 36 (L), 31 (W), 61 (W) - Darryan continues to fight his way back toward the top spot with a huge 61 pointer this week. Kelleher proving his worth to Brentford, double Arsenal clean sheets, Ballard acting as Gabriel-lite, and Cherki, Raul, and Haaland all pretending to be the goat Crysencio Summerville. Great work this week not putting every return on the bench by our League A leader o7.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Last 5: 61 (W), 60 (W), 31 (L), 44 (W), 49 (W) - Back on top of League B after a solid set of weeks including a big Hill pick up for his 7 pointer and Munoz finally returning. Too bad I pulled a Darryan and benched Ayari (just for him to get injured -.-). Anyway my team is pretty good and it's so late over here so take a look at the live page if you want to see how my team did this week.

Good luck all!
