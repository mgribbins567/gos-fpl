4,314 points for, 66 wins, 9 draws, 36 losses, and a 59.46% lifetime win rate, finally, capped by a league title. Congratulations to MatthewR for securing his spot as Season 3 Game of Stones champion this week!

Funnily enough, it comes because Matt loses rather than him winning, but a mathematical title win nonetheless!

And with that, happy gameweek 36! Waivers are due this week on Friday at 5:30am PDT / 8:30am EDT! Highlights this week include a big win for Luke 57-44 over MatthewR, Kevin securing the title for MatthewR and putting himself in a great spot with a 49-19 win over Matt, and Dylan pulling out the upset over Zach, 46-23.

Full results are as follows:

- Coop 18-24 Matthew
- Scott 27-16 Soph
- Darryan 30-16 Andrew
- Gavin 28-22 Emily
- Rebecca 30-43 Jesse
- Kevin 49-19 Matt
- MatthewR 44-57 Luke
- Dylan 46-23 Zach

<br/>

This week sees yet again a lot of movement across the table. Starting at the top, MatthewR's 10 point lead over Kevin is enough for the title, even if he loses out. Kevin's head to head over Matt takes him to 2nd, 1 point ahead of Luke, who also won this week. Matt sits behind him by just 1 point and 7 ahead of myself. Gavin's win takes him into sole ownership of 6th place, over Zach. Further down, Scott and Dylan's wins move them out of the relegation zone, seeing Emily and Coop fall into trouble.

Now onto the Game Changers! Pretty low scoring week this time, but we do have some new names which is fun!

- Matthew: Ruben Dias - A measly 7 points was the winner for me this week as Dias picked up a clean sheet and bonus point in City's 1-0 win over Wolves.
- Scott: Aaron Wan-Bissaka - The Bissaka-ssaince continues as the fullback picked up his 4th assist this season and 2 bonus points in West Ham's 1-1 draw against Spurs, for yet another 7 pointer.
- Darryan: Emi Martinez - Big week for the Aston Villa goalkeeper as he picked up a clean sheet, 3 saves, and 2 bonus points in Villa's 1-0 win against Fulham.
- Gavin: Josko Gvardiol - The Croat put up his own solid performance fending off Wolves, but picked up 1 more bonus point than Dias for 8 key points for Gavin this week.
- Jesse: Youri Tielemans - The Belgian has been cooking recently, with his 4th return in 5, this time picking up Villa's only goal and securing the 3 bonus points for an 11 pointer.
- Kevin: Kevin Schade - Back to back appearances for Kevin's namesake, this time his brace in Brentford's 4-3 win against Manchester United was enough for a huge 14 points (and only 2 bonus).
- Luke: Alejandro Garnacho - The inconsistent Argentine turned out to be a big pickup this week for Luke, as his goal and assist in the match just mentioned was enough for 3 bonus and 12 total points.
- Dylan: Murillo - Another key win for Dylan comes off the back of Murillo's quite well-done flick which ended up being Nottingham Forest's only goal in the 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace this week. That provided him with 2 bonus points, and a 10 pointer for Dylan.

The final month of the season kicks off with Luke taking the PF lead, with Kevin, Dylan, and Jesse not too far behind!

In terms of the form table, Luke and Kevin are still at the top with 15/15 points! Darryan is the sole manager who has earned 12/15 points in the past 5 weeks!

Next week sees some great matchups, headlined by yet another big match in the race for second between Luke and Kevin! Elsewhere, Matt has a must-win matchup against Rebecca and Soph and Coop look toward a relegation 6 pointer.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (5) vs Dylan (12)
- Zach (7) vs MatthewR (1)
- Luke (3) vs Kevin (2)
- Matt (4) vs Rebecca (8)
- Jesse (10) vs Gavin (6)
- Emily (13) vs Darryan (9)
- Andrew (16) vs Scott (11)
- Soph (15) vs Coop (14)

# The Run In

More movement!

### The Race for Top 4

<p class="center-bold">Top 4 Table</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/36/top-4-table.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br/>

- The winner of Kevin vs Luke this week will be firmly in the driver's seat for 2nd
- A win for Matt takes him to at least 3rd (could go 2nd in the case of a draw between Kevin and Luke)
- For me to reach 4th, I need one of Kevin, Luke, or Matt to lose out (and for me to win out). I also secure at least 5th with a win this week

<br/>

- Huge win for Dylan this week with his very tough schedule, taking him out of the danger zone
- The road to safety runs through Darryan, as his final 3 are Emily, Coop, and Soph
- Jesse and Dylan both have very difficult fixtures over the last 3 weeks (the latter being important when factoring 1 win from Emily/Coop puts them ahead of him)

Shoutout this week to Luke for 9 wins in a row! Also shoutouts to Kevin for a 6 winstreak, Darryan for 4 in a row and Scott for 3!
