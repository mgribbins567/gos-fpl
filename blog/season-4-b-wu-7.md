Elsewhere, Alex took a close 35-32 win over John, Andrew defeated ZachA 35-30, and Divya picked up a big 3 points in a 22-19 victory over Emma. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 40-27 Mack
- Alex 35-32 John
- Cara 37-34 Chris
- Andrew 35-30 ZachA
- Divya 22-19 Emma

<br/>

This week sees widespread movement across the table as myself and Alex sit at the top on a shared 15 points! Morgs stakes her claim in sole 3rd with 12, leapfrogging ZachA and Chris. Andrew, Cara, and Divya see themselves occupy the 6th-8th place spots following their wins.

And onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 13 pts - If a Brentford team led by 2 goals from a brand new striker from the Belgian league can't get Amorim sacked, can anyone?
- Alex: Jarrod Bowen - 9 pts - Ol' reliable strikes again. This time backed by not Graham Potter.
- Cara: Matheus Nunes - 12 pts - The only defender for Manchester City who scored and isn't named electronic Steve.
- Andrew: Erling Haaland - 16 pts - Unfortunately, Andrew had 6 players ruled out this week, fortunately, he had Haaland get 16 points and Doku get 10.
- Divya: Yankuba Minteh - 5 pts - This guy's really putting in a shift for Divya with back to back appearances here.
- Morgs: Michael Keane - 11 pts - The real Everton FWD was a center back named Michael all along.

Congratulations to Morgs for winning September manager of the month! As my team is ineligible, she won it by just 3 PF over Alex!

And we're finally at gameweek 6 so we can talk about the form table! Currently Alex sits atop it with 15/15 points earned in the last 5! I sit 2nd with 12/15 points.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 5 matchup between Chris and Morgs! Elsewhere, John takes on Divya and Mack faces off against Andrew in what should be a couple of interesting matches across the table! Full matchups are as follows:

- ZachA (4) vs Travis (12)
- Chris (5) vs Morgs (3)
- John (10) vs Divya (8)
- Mack (9) vs Andrew (6)

And lastly, shoutout to Alex for an impressive 5 wins in a row! Also, shoutouts to myself for 4 in a row, Morgs for 3 in a row, and Divya for going 2 undefeated (1W1D).

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 7 of The League(tm) group stage! Just 2 gameweeks left and still all to play for! Highlights from this week's slate of cross-league matches include a repeat scenario where the highest score in League A faced off against the highest score in League B, this time with Dylan defeating Morgs 54-51. Elsewhere, Alex picked up a close victory over Coop 35-31, Matt defeated Cara 42-37, Kevin took a narrow win over ZachA 35-30, Zach pulled out a win against Mack 32-27, and somehow my 24 pointer was enough to pick up a win against Emma, 24-19. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 24-19 Emma
- Luke 39-22 Divya
- MatthewR 41-32 John
- Gavin 32-40 Matthew2
- Darryan 52-35 Andrew
- Kevin 35-30 ZachA
- Dylan 54-51 Morgs
- Jesse 32-22 Travis
- Matt 42-37 Cara
- Coop 31-35 Alex
- Scott 22-34 Chris
- Zach 32-27 Mack

And as for the table, Jesse remains at the top with an undefeated 18 points! With a win this week he will confirm his spot in the top 8! However, he is followed closely by 5 managers sitting on 15 points: MatthewR, Dylan, Kevin, Chris, and Zach. Just behind those 6 are Darryan, Alex, and myself on 12 points, fighting for a spot in the top 8. Matthew2, Luke, and Matt are the teams with a 1 in the draw column on 10 points, and Andrew and John sit ahead of the group on 6 points in the middle of the top 8-16 zone(on 9 and 7 points, respectively).

Next week will have some great matchups, headlined by a top 7 match between Darryan and Chris! Other key matchups include a top 8 showdown between Kevin and Chris, and a top 10 match between Zach and Matthew2. We will also see MatthewR take on the September manager of the month for League B in Morgs, along with Coop and ZachA battling for a top 16 spot. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (9) vs Cara (22)
- Luke (11) vs Travis (20)
- MatthewR (2) vs Morgs (19)
- Gavin (21) vs Mack (16)
- Darryan (7) vs Chris (5)
- Kevin (4) vs Alex (8)
- Dylan (3) vs John (14)
- Jesse (1) vs Divya (23)
- Matt (12) vs Emma (24)
- Coop (17) vs ZachA (15)
- Scott (18) vs Andrew (13)
- Zach (6) vs Matthew2 (10)

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Kevin, Chris, Zach, ZachA, Coop
Fell off: Kevin, Chris

10 - Morgs (NEW) - League B - After all, this is a power ranking, so I think it's only fair to give the September manager of the month a spot on it. 3 wins in a row, averaging 43 per week across those and picking up the high score in a _very_ low scoring League B week.

9 - Dylan (NEW) - League A - Despite my distaste for a team that has Welbeck as the only serviceable FWD, his team seemingly continues to find a way to garner points, this time with a Gabriel 13 pointer. The injury to Livramento will hurt, though, considering his points from the start of the season are: 9, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6.

8 - Mack (-3) - League B - A rough week for Mack as she saw Tyrone Mings get injured, Elanga once again ride the bench for >60 minutes, and only get returns from Semenyo and Woltemade. Still think her team is good, but more points from Strand Larsen and Gyokeres are needed.

7 - Alex (+1) - League B - He's finding ways to win and keeps his spot atop the League B table, even with the off week. Bowen seems to be back to his usual ways and Odegaard is looking solid, so if he can find some more points from his defenders and 3rd/4th midfielders he'll only make his way up this list.

6 - Matthew (-3) - League A - A really rough week for my team and the (-3) might be an overreaction, considering the fact Mateta hit the inside of the post and Foden was robbed of a goal and assist by Steve... Still, my team has some question marks with its lack of defcon monsters.

5 - Jesse (+2) - League A - Am I appealing to him questioning my ranking every week? Maybe. Is he winning with 18 points on his bench and a red card on the field? Yep. It's hard to tell if the Sunderland keeper will keep up his insane form, but hey, it's working so far.

4 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - The golden defense moves up the list as none of them keep a clean sheet, yet 3/5 earned 3+ points this week. Nevermind Enzo somehow scoring his 3rd of the season and Watkins finally doing something.

3 - Luke (-1) - League A - Not much to say about this one as he's made solid moves to grab Senesi and Woltemade, who continue to bring in points. The only question mark is _when will Palmer return?_

2 - Darryan (+2) - League A - Haaland continues to wrack up points and Darryan puts up 52 with nothing more than a 2 pointer coming from his 5 player backline. Xhaka and Palhinha proved to be good pickups (at least this week), and triple Arsenal defense is always scary (if they all start).

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Hey, Rogers did something! Too bad I benched him for an Anderson 3 pointer. And Salah/Kudus/Rutter got me a total of 6 points, so a 40 point week to stay near the top of the overall PF table is solid.

Good luck all!
