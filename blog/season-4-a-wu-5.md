Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 5! Waivers this week are due once again on Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! Highlights from this week included the high scoring battle between MatthewR and Luke which ended with the latter winning 58-57 in _controversial_ fashion, Kevin taking home the 3 points over Jesse in another shootout 60-51, and Darryan keeping the winning streak alive with a 49-42 come from behind win against Zach. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 59-35 Matt
- MatthewR 57-58 Luke
- Scott 24-47 Dylan
- Kevin 60-51 Jesse
- Zach 42-49 Darryan
- Coop 38-27 Gavin

<br/>

This week sees Darryan keep his spot at the top by just 1 PF over Luke, who leapfrogged Dylan on PF. The three of them increased their gap over 4th to 6 whole points, as a slew of managers now sits on 2 wins.

Now onto this week's game changers!

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - Somehow, he leapt over Evanilson in the penalty pecking order and slotted away the winning goal against Brighton 2-1, along with picking up an assist. First player to reach 5 goal contributions this season (thankfully Haaland played the day after). A solid 13 points with the 3 bonus he earned.
- Luke: FPL Towers - The powers that be at FPL HQ gifted Luke 1 point at the death to poor Cole Palmer, who picked up his first open play goal since what, January?
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalhães - A solid defensive performance from Arsenal yet again as they pick up their 3rd clean sheet in 4 games, seeing Gabriel sneak in 10 defensive contributions for 1 bonus and 9 total points for Dylan.
- Kevin: Moisés Caicedo - The Chelsea defensive midfielder picked up another _17_ defensive contributions along with blasting the ball into the back of the net against Brentford to take home all 3 bonus points and 12 total to lead Kevin's team to victory.
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - Maybe he saw the "M" in Manchester United and thought it was Moldova? Because his performance was absurd, picking up 2 goals and 8 defensive contributions, on top of hitting the post. 13 pointer for the machine.
- Coop: Pape Matar Sarr - A tidy 8 pointer from a goal and clean sheet from the Senegalese as Spurs stroll to victory 4-0 against West Ham.

Welcome to September! With just 3 gameweeks this month, we're already 1/3 done, with Kevin leading! I sit just 1 PF behind and Luke 2.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top half matchup between myself and Darryan, as I look to hand him his first loss! Elsewhere, Zach is hoping to pick up his 2nd win of the season against Luke and Jesse looks to close the gap on the top 3 with a win against Gavin. Full matchups are as follows:

- Darryan vs Matthew
- Jesse vs Gavin
- Dylan vs Coop
- Luke vs Zach
- Matt vs Kevin
- MatthewR vs Scott

And lastly, shoutouts to Darryan, Dylan, and Luke for all being on ~~3~~4 winstreaks!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 5 of The League(tm) group stage! We are officially at the halfway point! This week saw a slightly more amicable split between the leagues, with perhaps the most interesting result coming in the 35-35 draw between Matt and John! Elsewhere, the top scorers this week from both leagues squared off as Kevin defeats Mack 60-52, Jesse narrowly defeats Emma 51-45, and Zach stumps his counterpart in League B ZachA 42-33. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 59-45 Travis
- Luke 58-31 Morgs
- MatthewR 57-19 Cara
- Gavin 27-51 Chris
- Darryan 49-38 Alex
- Kevin 60-52 Mack
- Dylan 47-19 Divya
- Jesse 51-45 Emma
- Matt 35-35 John
- Coop 38-51 Andrew
- Scott 24-50 Matthew2
- Zach 42-33 ZachA

Taking a look over at the table, MatthewR and Jesse continue their winning ways and sit atop the table with 12 points! 6 managers sit behind them on 9 points, led by Darryan and Kevin, as the race for the quarter final spots heats up. Further down, Luke and Matthew2 sit at 7 points following their draw last week, also with the same exact PF, so that's interesting.

Next week should have some great matchups, headlined by the Semenyo derby between myself and Mack! Elsewhere, Luke faces off against Alex, MatthewR hopes to pick up his 5th win against Chris, and Jesse faces off against Matthew2 in what could be a pivotal matchup to start the second half of games.

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Alex, Chris, Andrew, Zach
Fell off: Zach

10 - Kevin (NEW) - League A - A 60 pointer this week has snuck him onto this list as the Xavi play paid off. Caicedo is an absolute defcon monster and Gyokeres is looking to be the real deal with his 3rd goal of the season.

9 - Dylan (+1) - League A - Somehow still undefeated off the back of a clean sheet heavy week. Gabriel and the other Arsenal defenders continue to prove why they are worth an early round pick and Salah always scores. I do worry about Sels and the state of his FWDs (and am kinda surprised he didn't go for any this past week).

8 - Jesse (+1) - League A - If Doku can replicate what he did against Manchester United every match and Sunderland keeps 34 more clean sheets, Jesse is a lock to keep moving up this ranking. However, he does have a _heavy_ reliance on Manchester City and a hospital ward on his bench, so we'll see how his team progresses.

7 - ZachA (-5) - League B - Okay, so maybe I overrated his team a little last week, but I didn't _really_ have a choice. That said, he _also_ has an ICU for a bench and a reliance on Chelsea players. However, he does have a solid midfield and FWD grouping (if he doesn't have to play Osula week-in-week-out).

6 - Mack (+1) - League B - Her team is knocking on the door of the top 5 and I was really having trouble between mine and hers. Elanga and Barnes prove to be elusive when it comes to minutes, but Eze is already starting and contributing for Arsenal, Gyokeres is scoring, and even Woltemade picked up a goal in his debut. Combine that with Semenyo and some solid defenders and this makes for a very good team.

5 - Matthew (+1) - League A - I mean, biased, but Semenyo is a beast, Newcastle has 3 clean sheets in 4, and Munoz's floor is currently at 5 points, PLUS Phil Foden is back (inb4 he gets benched next week for no reason). The only question marks are Solanke, because who knows if he's out for 1 week or 4 months, and Wissa, because of the skyscraper of a German they just signed, but I think both will get plenty of minutes as the season progresses. Plus, even with a Mateta 2 pointer, Semenyo and Foden can carry my team to a 59 pointer.

4 - MatthewR (+1) - League A - Again, it's a confusing team, and all his points come from defenders, but _it works_. The Odegaard injury is concerning, however, and Aston Villa looks to be nosediving by the minute, so I am worried for this team if there are any fewer clean sheets than this week.

3 - Luke (+1) - League A - He's the chosen team. He has Cole Palmer and will win the league because the powers behind Fantasy Premier League have decided. I don't make the rules. Anyway, well rounded team, with my only worry being Gakpo's minutes and how long Marmoush is out for.

2 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Haaland looks to be back to his robotic ways this season and obviously Arsenal defenders have been huge for Darryan. He's winning and leaving a couple points on the bench, what more could you ask for.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - A solid 50 pointer this week, along with a shored up bench that now contains Senesi. Really just waiting on Morgan Rogers to do something, anything really would be nice. The theme this week is that every team gets a clean sheet, so following in MatthewR's footsteps I guess.

Good luck this week!
