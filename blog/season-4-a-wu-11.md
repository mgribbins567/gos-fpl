Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 39-57 Kevin

<br/>

In terms of the table, Darryan keeps his spot on top by just ~~2~~4 PF over Dylan who keeps it tied at 24 points! The duo extend their lead over Luke by 3 points, who still sits just 3 ahead of Jesse. MatthewR's win sees him join Jesse on 18, slightly behind on PF. Zach rounds out the top half falling below MatthewR and keeping his spot 3 points ahead of me. Kevin and Matt's wins sees them join myself and Coop on 12 points.

And now, the game changers! This week I'm going to use the League B format to save some time.

- Kevin: Moises Caicedo - 10 pts - Defcon beast learned to tackle in the box and make Joao Pedro put a shot on target.
- Scott: Harry Wilson - 10 pts - Fulham score 3 goals in 100% of the games Harry Wilson scores - coincidence?
- MatthewR: Maxence Lacroix - 8 pts - Defcon team got 4 defcon points and 3 clean sheets and won.
- Matt: Jacob Murphy - 8 pts - Somehow this guy was tied with O'Reilly on points and bps so I thought it'd be funnier to give it to the guy who scored the only goal in a 3-1 loss to West Ham.
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - 13 pts - 13 points for from his 13th goal in 10 games. Can this guy be stopped please.
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalhaes - 12 pts - Last time this guy got less than 9 points was gameweek 5...

In the first of 4 gameweeks in November, Darryan takes the lead! He is just ahead of Dylan and Kevin on PF!

In terms of form, Darryan takes the top spot with 12/15 points earned by just 2 PF over Dylan! MatthewR also joins them at 4 wins out of 5.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge top 3 matchup between Dylan and Luke! Elsewhere, we will see two in-form teams face off in Darryan and MatthewR, Coop take on Kevin, and Zach and myself try to figure out which of us is unluckier. Full matchups are as follows:

- Zach (6) vs Matthew (7)
- Coop (10) vs Kevin (8)
- Gavin (12) vs Scott (11)
- Darryan (1) vs MatthewR (5)
- Jesse (4) vs Matt (9)
- Dylan (2) vs Luke (3)

Shoutouts this week go to Dylan and MatthewR for their 3 winstreaks! Also to Matt and Scott for back to back wins!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Gavin, Alex, Jesse, Matt, MatthewR
Fell off: Alex, Jesse

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Chris is riding the defcon wave, with Caicedo, Rice, and Xhaka all putting in work over the past couple of weeks. If only Watkins could figure out wtf he's doing.

9 - ZachA (NEW) - League B - Another solid run of form from ZachA sees him back on this list as Cherki re-emerges in the Manchester City lineup. Pedro also remembered what it feels like to put the goal in the back of the net and somehow (not super surprisingly) Chelsea kept a clean sheet against Spurs and Zach found 20 points.

8 - John (+2) - League B - John has been flying up the table in League B from 10th in week 6 to 4th now off the back of a 4 week run of 39/59/49/44. That is with Gabriel being an automatic 9 points, Szoboszlai and Bruno Fernandes being the machines they are, and despite Mateta not knowing actually where the goal is.

7 - Mack (-3) - League B - Definitely a rough couple of weeks for Mack as she seems to love the number 32 and running the bad luck in League B factory with Travis. Surely the team will bounce back though once Semenyo doesn't have to face defensive stalwarts in Manchester City and... Nottingham Forest and Gyokeres rests instead of losing more games with Sweden.

6 - Zach (+1) - League A - Another team with a fairly middling week on this list off the back of FWDs doing nothing and Casemiro (?) sitting the bench with 12 (?) points. Still a solid team with Trossard seemingly being the starter for Arsenal and Rogers finding himself coming out of the Manchester City / Liverpool double header.

5 - Luke (-2) - League A - Similarly, Luke has fallen onto rough times with not a lot happening between Pino/Marmoush/Gakpo and Ndiaye going off injured. Perhaps we'll see the rare 5-2-3 next week since Delap is back?

4 - Matthew (+2) - League A - I mean I'm getting absolutely destroyed by fixtures but still putting up ~40 points pretty consistently. Mitoma comes back soon (copium), Foden scored 2 very Foden goals in the midweek, and idk maybe I'll be more active on the waiver wire or something. (I'm tired of losing to 50+ pointers)

3 - Dylan (+2) - League A - Okay I'm respecting the Gabriel owner here and moving him further up the board. Salah found a 2nd goal in 2 games and barely passes Minteh on total points this season after the latter got 2 assists over the weekend. And, somehow, Welbeck returned and scored his 6th goal in the last 5 weeks. If you still had him, maybe you'd be on this list, Matthew.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - The other Salah team, this time with Rogers/Kudus/Anderson in tow. Plus, Evanilson is back, Wood will surely return one of these days to play Dyche-ball, and Fulham finally kept a clean sheet?

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Haaland is just a cheat code. Plus, Cherki is back, Xhaka scored his first goal in a Sunderland kit, and Arsenal picked up their _7th_ clean sheet this season. _A quick reminder that Darryan has 3 starting Arsenal defenders_. Also, he scored 60 points and didn't even play Saliba.

Good luck all!
