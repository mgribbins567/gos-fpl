Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 25! Waivers this week were due this morning at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST so free agency is open! Some high scoring matches this week, led by ZachA's 53-43 upset over John! Elsewhere, I defeated Chris 49-39, Morgs picked up a big win over Cara 42-30, and Alex put up a week high 56 to Travis's 23! Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 49-39 Chris
- John 43-53 ZachA
- Mack 41-26 Emma
- Alex 56-23 Travis
- Cara 30-42 Morgs
- Andrew 50-21 Divya

<br/>

Over on the league table, my win and John's loss see my team back to the top of the table by 2 points! And just below John, Alex leapfrogs Chris to move up to 3rd, just 4 points off the top 2. Chris sits level on points with ZachA, 2 points behind Alex. Mack and Morgs's wins see them moving ahead of Emma, just 7 points behind 5th.

Game Changers! Btw I didn't watch the games this week so these may be a little bereft of detail.

- Matthew: Daniel Ballard - 9 pts - I can't believe I live in the neighborhood named after this guy and only now have him on my team. AND he's the highest scorer of the week. Hell yeah.
- ZachA: Joao Pedro - 10 pts - I didn't think this was allowed, but somehow JP has evolved his game to score in 3 games in a row. This is big for Chelsea fans (and Zach and Kevin).
- Mack: Casemiro - 13 pts - Huge week for Casemiro as he picked up his 6th yellow card of the season. And also a goal and assist and clean sheet point as Manchester United defeated Fulham 3-2.
- Alex: Jarrod Bowen - 8 pts - Huge week for the defcon beast as he scores his 8th of the season to bring home a solid 8 pointer.
- Morgs: Martin Zubimendi - 10 pts - The new ~~Gyokeres~~Merino? Stick this guy up top and he'll score 20/season why not.
- Andrew: Noni Madueke - 14 pts - This guy didn't know he was starting until 10 minutes before the game and pulls up with a goal and an assist (and clean sheet and all 3 bonus). All in a 60 minute's work.

Congratulations to Alex for winning January manager of the month! With an undefeated 15/15 points earned!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be a fun one between Chris and Alex! Elsewhere, two in-form teams go head to head as John takes on Mack, Emma faces off against Andrew, and Morgs looks to help out John in her matchup against me! Full matchups are as follows:

- Morgs (7) vs Matthew (1) (all-time: 0-0-2, 65-94)
- Travis (12) vs Divya (11) (all-time: 1-0-1, 59-48)
- Emma (8) vs Andrew (10) (all-time: 1-0-1, 72-62)
- ZachA (5) vs Cara (9) (all-time: 3-0-2, 150-119)
- Chris (4) vs Alex (3) (all-time: 0-0-2, 73-78)
- John (2) vs Mack (6) (all-time: 1-0-1, 86-91)

Shoutouts this week to Alex for his 6 winstreak! Also to ZachA for 4 wins in a row, and to me and Morgs for picking up back to back wins!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Matt, Alex
Fell off: None
On a tear but I can't find a place on the list for him right now: ZachA

10 - Dylan (-) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 29 (L), 49 (W), 48 (L), 40 (L) - Another tough loss this week for Dylan as this time his decision to bench Dango is what did him in. Some solid showings though with Szoboszlai, Salah, and Janelt all picking up 4/5 pointers and Mukiele continuing his crazy 3 assists in a row run. That means the last time he had less than 3 points in a week was gameweek 15, _9_ weeks ago (and he only had 3 points once in that timeframe). He's almost better than Gabriel at this point.

9 - Kevin (-1) - League A - Last 5: 45 (W), 39 (L), 36 (L), 27 (L), 47 (W) - Sorry Kevin had to do some leveling of the Power Rankings this week which meant even with a 47 you got a down arrow. That said, very solid week, with Joao Pedro breaking his curse, Gyokeres breaking his curse, and MGW being an absolute beast over the last 5 weeks and scoring yet again. Too bad about the random Ayari injury and ineffective defensive line (other than Konate on the bench). Is Konate good again? Or did he just learn how to score somehow.

8 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 31 (W), 42 (W), 32 (W), 43 (L), 43 (L) - I think he said so himself but he _really_ should try not scoring 43 points. That's back to back losses with the same score which was enough for him to drop to 2nd in League B. If he can figure out this whole luck thing though I think he'll be fine, as Bruno Fernandes is looking like possibly the best MID to own in the game, Gabriel is almost definitely the best DEF, and DCL is the best player period. If only he could stem the injury crisis that has been plaguing his Leeds and Everton players.

7 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 28 (L), 40(L), 21 (L), 35 (W), 40 (W) - Welp, the Ekitike drought was not long lasting as he scored 2 against Newcastle and carried the remainder of Zach's team to victory. Sesko helped, although I'm not really sure how this guy scores 2 goals, then has _25_ minutes in the next 3 matches. Carrick at the wheel I guess. You gotta respect the 5-2-3 though considering Saka, Onana, and Tavernier are all MIA.

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Last 5: 30 (L), 40 (W), 28 (W), 38 (W), 34 (L) - Okay, maybe I am cooked. For some reason I benched Gakpo at the last second and lost by 1 instead of scraping by with another lucky win. My only saving grace this week was Semenyo doing Semenyo things and Solanke scoring a Guehi own goal and a crazy scorpion kick. That's my 2nd round pick!! Hoping and asking an etsy witch to get Foden some starts (and some goals) soon.

5 - MatthewR (-2) - League A - Last 5: 51 (W), 30 (L), 37 (W), 49 (W), 27 (L) - Maybe this guy's also cooked. Schade red card, Odegaard flagged, Gordon injured, maybe Watkins will be back this weekend? But hey Enzo Fernandez is somehow probably the best player on Chelsea having picked up 4 goals and an assist in the last 6 games. Havertz is back though :kai:

4 - Chris (+1) - League B - Last 5: 63 (W), 36 (W), 35 (L), 52 (W), 39 (L) - An unfortunate loss with 39 points off the back of the double Bournemouth clean sheet and now much else going on. _Is Barry good?_ _Is Wilson the goat?_ _Will Watkins be back this weekend?_ So many questions and so few answers.

3 - Mack (+3) - League B - Last 5: 41 (W), 53 (W), 28 (L), 45 (L), 41 (W) - A big jump up the board for Mack as I continue doing some leveling and acknowledge her impressive record of having only 1 gameweek less than 41 in the last 8 weeks (incoming jinx). Point coming from Semenyo, Casemiro, and Garner all being weirdly consistent, on top of defcon beasts such as Milenkovic, Collins, Guehi, and Andersen. Plus sometimes Gyokeres can score. Sometimes. Oh and a huge Strand Larsen move to Crystal Palace could see him being the starting striker for Munoz to cross the ball to.

2 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 43 (D), 58 (W), 36 (L), 31 (W), 61 (W) - Darryan continues to fight his way back toward the top spot with a huge 61 pointer this week. Kelleher proving his worth to Brentford, double Arsenal clean sheets, Ballard acting as Gabriel-lite, and Cherki, Raul, and Haaland all pretending to be the goat Crysencio Summerville. Great work this week not putting every return on the bench by our League A leader o7.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Last 5: 61 (W), 60 (W), 31 (L), 44 (W), 49 (W) - Back on top of League B after a solid set of weeks including a big Hill pick up for his 7 pointer and Munoz finally returning. Too bad I pulled a Darryan and benched Ayari (just for him to get injured -.-). Anyway my team is pretty good and it's so late over here so take a look at the live page if you want to see how my team did this week.

Good luck all!
