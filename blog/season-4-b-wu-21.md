Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 21! Another quick turnaround (before a 9 day break) since there are midweek matches starting Tuesday so free agency is already open! A lot of blowouts this week, with the most interesting result coming from Mack's 41-32 win over Morgs! Elsewhere, Andrew upset Cara 44-32, John defeated Travis by a score of 31-24, and Chris put up a week high 63 to Emma's 28. Full results are as follows:

- ZachA 25-61 Matthew
- Chris 63-28 Emma
- John 31-24 Travis
- Mack 41-32 Morgs
- Alex 58-16 Divya
- Cara 32-44 Andrew

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, John keeps his 1 point lead over me at the top, with Chris still 5 points back. This time though he does have a 3 point lead over Emma, who sees Alex close the gap to just 1 point. He now sits 2 points above ZachA, who is ahead of Mack and Morgs by just a single point. Further down, Andrew's win takes him level on points with Divya, 7 points behind Cara.

Game Changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 17 pts - This dude's just on fire. 14 goals (so far) in his first premier league season, coming from the Belgian league, and playing for a Brentford side who just had their manager poached and who is now coached by their _old set piece coach_. Absolutely crazy stuff from them.
- Chris: Declan Rice - 17 pts - His annual "score the same goal twice" game has happened with 2 clean passes into the net against Bournemouth as Arsenal pick up points while everyone else doesn't for the second week in a row. 100 million was a steal, West Ham.
- John: Gabriel Magalhaes - 9 pts - Apparently he doesn't need to head the ball to score? Or maybe he just needs to give the other team a goal first to unlock that ability.
- Mack: Nathan Collins - 10 pts - Who knew the ex-Wolves center back could turn attacker with a goal and an assist. He almost had defcon too, poor guy.
- Alex: Malick Thiaw - 17 pts - It's getting suspicious how many center backs who scored are on this list... but hey 17 points is apparently pretty common these days.
- Andrew: Matheus Cunha - 9 pts - Didn't watch this game tbh but I feel like the fact that Manchester United drew against Leeds and then Amorim got sacked has gotta be pretty telling. Maybe if Cunha could have had a few more wild shots from outside the box Ruben wouldn't be dapping up paparazzi outside his house.

Just 1 week into January and Chris has taken the lead on PF! Me, Alex, Andrew, and Mack all have wins and 40+ PF this week!

In terms of form, John continues his reign at the top with a perfect 15/15 points earned! He is followed by Chris on 13/15 and Emma on 12!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be an interesting one between Emma and ZachA! Elsewhere, Morgs takes on the league leader, John, Andrew looks to keep his momentum going against Alex, and I take on Cara! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (2) vs Cara (9)
- Andrew (10) vs Alex (5)
- Divya (11) vs Mack (7)
- Morgs (8) vs John (1)
- Travis (12) vs Chris (3)
- Emma (4) vs ZachA (6)

Shoutouts this week go to John for 6 wins in a row and to Chris for 6 unbeaten (5W1D)! Also, to Mack for 3 wins in a row and Alex for back to back victories!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Alex, Matt, Luke
Fell off: None

10 - John (-3) - League B - Last 5: 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W) - Yep, that's 5 wins in his last 5, but he's seeing some cracks starting to form with DCL unable to score in back to back games, Mateta pulling off his usual disappearing act, and Gabriel being the only one to return. On top of that, KLP seems in and out of the starting 11, Everton's defense is evidently _not_ impenetrable, and O'Reilly's CS odds surely will suffer following the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias. That said, Bruno Fernandes is back soon, which is enormous for John's team. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the coming weeks.

9 - Emma (-3) - League B - Last 5: 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W), 50 (W), 28 (L) - Maybe a bit harsh for a (-3) after one off week, but she will be seeing the direct impacts of the Ruben Dias injury and more and more of her team is transitioning to the injury table or the bench. On the other hand though, Wirtz has been killing it recently, Trossard spent ~2/3 of the game on the bench resting up for the midweek match, and Foden could drop a 15 pointer at a moment's notice.

8 - Mack (+2) - League B - Last 5: 28 (L), 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W) - A solid last 4 for Mack as she slowly climbs up the League B table off the back of consistent performances from Collins, Casemiro, Miley, and Garner. Some solid defenders who consistently get defcon too... if only Gyokeres could score.

7 - Chris (+2) - League B - Last 5: 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W) - And the League B chain continues with the Declan Rice owner! On top of that, Reijnders decided to show up again for the _Festive Fixtures_, Xhaka continues his signing of the season level performances, and Harry Wilson is the next Messi. Solid 63 pointer for Chris this week.

6 - Kevin (+2) - League A - Last 5: 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W) - Really interesting tidbit here is that Kevin has now scored exactly 45 points 4 times this season. There are only 9 instances of 45 being scored in League A. Is there some sort of statistical probability that having a certain combination of returns makes you more likely to score _exactly_ 45 points? Maybe he continues to get 15+ point returns from his players and then a bunch of 2s, 0s, and 1s? Why is he never scoring in the low 40s? It's either 33-36 or 45 (or 50+). Just baffling and I don't have the statistics degree or mental energy to deduce this at 11pm at night. Maybe I'll write a theorem tomorrow to figure out how he does this. Anyway, nice week buddy.

5 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Last 5: 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L) - I'll continue using this as a platform to hate and overrate my team because honestly I know a lot of you guys just ctrl-f your name and see what I have to say about you. Anyway I would've done much better had Gakpo not hit the post and scored while offside, and if Wissa was like 2 inches less wide than he is. Or maybe if Mateta or Foden could actually do something every once in a while that would be nice. Anyway Gakpo did score and had a lot of chances so I'm not too upset with a loss. It was bound to happen.

4 - MatthewR (+1) - League A - Last 5: 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W) - Gavin didn't deserve this one bro... an Enzo Fernandez goal in the 94th minute to not only send Gavin into the shadow realm (930 PA btw) but also cause Darryan to salvage a _draw_ against Matt. Anyway, Watkins good, Odegaard good, Van de Ven good.

3 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Last 5: 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W) - Interesting what happens when I trust my gut and randomly sign _Vitaly Janelt_ who went on to get 2 assists and defcon. Maybe I should do that more often in League A. Anyway, solid performance to reconcile some of the past weeks' losses. Evanilson on the scoresheet (shoutout Gabriel), Anderson defcons away, Rogers gets an assist, and even Bart got a clean sheet.

2 - Zach (-1) - League A - Last 5: 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L) - Rough one this week for Zach as not only does he drop his first score in the 20s this season but he also loses Gvardiol to a broken leg bone (or somewhere in his ankle maybe? nobody posted the xray in the discord). Anyway his normal guys all did pretty well with Saka getting an assist off the bench, Rogers getting an assist while starting, and Casemiro somehow being Zach's best player and consistently being able to get points against some of the worst teams in the league. That said, he needs some of his other guys to show up (and maybe for Ekitike to not be injured... and be better than Gakpo at playing up top).

1 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Last 5:46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D) - You know what, 5 weeks at 40+ with a loss and a draw is quite a bit unlucky, especially when this week Evanilson's goal looms on the bench. But, weird circumstances turning a loss into a draw is what happens when you're at the top of the table. And that one point could make a difference. Also, a really interesting spread of point scorers from Darryan this week, a goal from Aaronson and Rutter, defcon from Xhaka, Cherki, and Rodri, an assist from Raul. Really a team effort to disappoint Matt. Well done taking top spot off the back of that.

Good luck all!
