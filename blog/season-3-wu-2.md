Happy gameweek 2! Waivers this week are due on Friday, August 23rd at 3am PDT/6am EDT, so get those waivers in! I hope everyone enjoyed their first week, there were a lot of interesting fixtures so let's jump right in! Starting with our marquee matchup that everyone expected: Scott vs Matt! This high scoring matchup saw Scott take an early lead off the back of a Danny Welbeck 12 pointer and Matt eventually claw it back with solid weeks from Mbeumo, Porro, and Haaland to take the win 49-47. Elsewhere, Andrew put up a week high 52 points in his 52-42 Gribbins derby against me and Soph picks up a win in the closest (and lowest scoring) match of the week in her 21-17 win over Emily.

Full results are as follows:

- Andrew 52 - 42 Matthew
- Soph 21 - 17 Emily
- Coop 20 - 29 Jesse
- Scott 47 - 49 Matt
- Darryan 37 - 45 Luke
- Gavin 27 - 34 Zach
- Rebecca 35 - 20 Dylan
- Kevin 28 - 39 MatthewR

This week sees Andrew take the top spot in the league after Gameweek 1! He is closely followed by Matt and Luke. Not much to say about the table this early in the season, there will be a _ton_ of movement from week to week!

So I've been thinking a bit about how to make these updates a little more personal, a little less 'I scored 42 and lost,' and I've come up with this section! This is what I'm going to call the _Game Changers of the Week_ (name pending). Basically, which player 'won' each manager the week. For now I'll keep it fairly brief (since these things are so damn long), but let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements in the future!

- Andrew: Wissa - Gotta give it to the main man at Brentford. 11 points from a goal, assist, and 3 bonus. Looks like Toney is on the way out so should be seeing this guy a lot this season.
- Soph: Trent Alexander-Arnold - 8 points from a defender in a 2-0 win is very solid. According to sources (I was asleep at the time), he ran the game and despite having no goal involvements, picked up 2 bonus points.
- Jesse: Ruben Dias - Difficult decision for Jesse's team with his points coming from many sources, but Dias put in a solid shift good for 6 points and his performance put him just outside of the bonus point conversation.
- Matt: Bryan Mbeumo - Honestly, just a great performance by the 40 year old against Crystal Palace. A goal and 2 bonus points for his took him to 9 points, leading Matt's team to a victory.
- Luke: Kai Havertz - How could it not be? 12 points from a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points. Solid performance from him and well worth the 1st rounder so far.
- Zach: Alisson - A 7 pointer and somehow _28 bps_ with only 2 saves against Ipswich is solid. Clean sheet + 1 bonus point was enough to take Zach to a win over Gavin this first week.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - The overall player of the week with 14 points, sets the premier league record for most Gameweek 1 goals, and accounts for 40% of Rebecca's score this gameweek. Easiest choice on the list. (1 goal, 1 assist, 3 bonus, clean sheet)
- MatthewR: Nick Pope - After Newcastle went down to 10 men, Pope evidently stepped up, producing a 9 point week with 3 saves and 2 bonus points from 27 bps, leading MatthewR to victory over Kevin.

Since this is the first week of a month, the Manager of the Month table is the same as the current league table with Andrew leading! This month is only 3 gameweeks, so everyone's still in it!

The Form table is also the same as the current league table, so I won't be introducing that one until probably Gameweek 6!

Next week we will see some great matchups! This week will be headlined by Luke vs Scott, who were the 3rd and 4th highest scorers this week! Other interesting matchups include Dylan vs Gavin, a matchup between two teams you expect to make a number of changes this week, Zach and Darryan, who each scored similarly this week and will hope to continue the solid scores, and Soph vs Jesse, who were the two lowest scorers to come out with wins this week. Full matchups are:

- Matthew (10) vs Kevin (12)
- MatthewR (4) vs Rebecca (5)
- Dylan (14) vs Gavin (12)
- Zach (6) vs Darryan (11)
- Luke (3) vs Scott (9)
- Matt (2) vs Coop (14)
- Jesse (7) vs Soph (9)
- Emily (16) vs Andrew (1)

Lastly, some shoutouts! Andrew gets the highest praise here, 50+ points in the first week and while going full autodraft- incredible work with Mosquera first round! Also, shoutout our 2nd and 3rd high scorers, Matt and Scott, who faced off against each other and put up 49 and 47 points, respectively.
