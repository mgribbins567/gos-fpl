Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 43-10 Cara

<br/>

Taking a look at the league table, I keep my pace at the top with a 3 point lead over Chris, who is now followed by ZachA just 2 points back. John also moves up the board, level on points with Alex at 18. Mack and Morgs sit just 3 points behind them, maintaining a 2 point gap over Andrew (with his win) and Cara. Divya also sees herself move up the table 3 points behind the duo on 13 points.

And now, the game changers!

- Matthew: Mohamed Salah - 10 pts - Finally the FPL king remembered he can score in back to back games.
- Andrew: Erling Haaland - 13 pts - Finally the FPL king remembered he can score 2 goals in 5 games this season.
- Divya: Yankuba Minteh - 9 pts - KdB is back? 5 assists in 10 weeks is crazy work.
- John: Gabriel Magalhaes - 12 pts - Who knew a defender would be the 2nd best FPL asset this season.
- Chris: Declan Rice - 13 pts - This guy decided he'd get **all** the defcon against Burnley (21).
- ZachA: Rayan Cherki - 10 pts - How they got this dude for so cheap... I don't know. He's so good x4

In the first of 4 gameweeks in November, ZachA takes the lead on PF! He is just ahead of Chris, John, and myself who also scored 40+!

In terms of form, John takes the top spot on PF with 12/15 points earned! Chris and I are the only other managers with 4 wins in the past 5 weeks!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 3 match between ZachA and Chris! Elsewhere, Morgs and Alex look to right their recent form with a win in their matchup, Divya takes on Cara in what should be an interesting one, and we see our first me vs Andrew Gribbins derby! Full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew (8) vs Matthew (1)
- Divya (10) vs Cara (9)
- Morgs (7) vs Alex (5)
- Travis (12) vs Mack (6)
- Emma (11) vs John (4)
- ZachA (3) vs Chris (2)

Shoutouts this week go to Chris and John for picking up 4 winstreaks! Also to ZachA for back to back wins and Andrew for 2 undefeated in a row(1W1D)!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Gavin, Alex, Jesse, Matt, MatthewR
Fell off: Alex, Jesse

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Chris is riding the defcon wave, with Caicedo, Rice, and Xhaka all putting in work over the past couple of weeks. If only Watkins could figure out wtf he's doing.

9 - ZachA (NEW) - League B - Another solid run of form from ZachA sees him back on this list as Cherki re-emerges in the Manchester City lineup. Pedro also remembered what it feels like to put the goal in the back of the net and somehow (not super surprisingly) Chelsea kept a clean sheet against Spurs and Zach found 20 points.

8 - John (+2) - League B - John has been flying up the table in League B from 10th in week 6 to 4th now off the back of a 4 week run of 39/59/49/44. That is with Gabriel being an automatic 9 points, Szoboszlai and Bruno Fernandes being the machines they are, and despite Mateta not knowing actually where the goal is.

7 - Mack (-3) - League B - Definitely a rough couple of weeks for Mack as she seems to love the number 32 and running the bad luck in League B factory with Travis. Surely the team will bounce back though once Semenyo doesn't have to face defensive stalwarts in Manchester City and... Nottingham Forest and Gyokeres rests instead of losing more games with Sweden.

6 - Zach (+1) - League A - Another team with a fairly middling week on this list off the back of FWDs doing nothing and Casemiro (?) sitting the bench with 12 (?) points. Still a solid team with Trossard seemingly being the starter for Arsenal and Rogers finding himself coming out of the Manchester City / Liverpool double header.

5 - Luke (-2) - League A - Similarly, Luke has fallen onto rough times with not a lot happening between Pino/Marmoush/Gakpo and Ndiaye going off injured. Perhaps we'll see the rare 5-2-3 next week since Delap is back?

4 - Matthew (+2) - League A - I mean I'm getting absolutely destroyed by fixtures but still putting up ~40 points pretty consistently. Mitoma comes back soon (copium), Foden scored 2 very Foden goals in the midweek, and idk maybe I'll be more active on the waiver wire or something. (I'm tired of losing to 50+ pointers)

3 - Dylan (+2) - League A - Okay I'm respecting the Gabriel owner here and moving him further up the board. Salah found a 2nd goal in 2 games and barely passes Minteh on total points this season after the latter got 2 assists over the weekend. And, somehow, Welbeck returned and scored his 6th goal in the last 5 weeks. If you still had him, maybe you'd be on this list, Matthew.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - The other Salah team, this time with Rogers/Kudus/Anderson in tow. Plus, Evanilson is back, Wood will surely return one of these days to play Dyche-ball, and Fulham finally kept a clean sheet?

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Haaland is just a cheat code. Plus, Cherki is back, Xhaka scored his first goal in a Sunderland kit, and Arsenal picked up their _7th_ clean sheet this season. _A quick reminder that Darryan has 3 starting Arsenal defenders_. Also, he scored 60 points and didn't even play Saliba.

Good luck all!
