Hello everyone and congratulations to the winner of the Champions Cup this season: Luke!

He fended off Kevin in the second leg to take home a 91-81 victory!

Darryan faired similarly, losing the second leg but holding onto the lead in our third place match against MatthewR 63-56.

In the fifth place matchup between Rebecca and Coop, the former wins the tie overcoming her deficit and winning 69-56.

For seventh, Zach put up the same winning score against Andrew 69-32.

I secure ninth with a 91-64 win against Scott.

Gavin follows suit for 11th in his 82-47 victory over Emily.

Dylan's second leg total is not enough as Jesse takes 13th by a score of 59-49.
