Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 12! I hope y'all had a great international break and I'm sorry to the Gabriel owners out there for your loss o7. Waivers this week are due Friday at 3:00am PDT / 6:00am EDT! Highlights from this week include our 3rd draw of the season between Emma and John at 35 apiece! Elsewhere, Divya defeated Cara 60-37, Morgs picked up a big 55-31 win over Alex, and ZachA defeated Chris 43-26. Full results are as follows:

- Andrew 33-53 Matthew
- Divya 60-37 Cara
- Morgs 55-31 Alex
- Travis 42-24 Mack
- Emma 35-35 John
- ZachA 43-26 Chris

<br/>

Looking over at the table, my lead at the top has been extended to 5 points, this time above ZachA, who leapfrogs Chris by a point after his head to head win. John's draw sees him move just 2 back of Chris now, 1 ahead of Alex who is joined at 18 points by Morgs who has overtaken her sister. Mack is now just 2 points ahead of the trio of Andrew, Divya, and Cara.

And now, onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 13 pts - Huge week for the freshman striker from the Belgian league as he scored _twice_ against Newcastle to add to his now 8 goal total for the campaign.
- Divya: Bukayo Saka - 12 pts - A deserved 12 points as apparently he put in a shift against Sunderland in the 2-2 draw between probably the 2 favorites to win the league.
- Morgs: Michael Keane - 15 pts - I mean he's a striker playing center back. Come on Moyes put him up top.
- Travis: Malo Gusto - 15 pts - A week of blue kitted goal scorers getting 15 pointers eh? Wolves is dire but I guess Chelsea is also pretty good?
- John: Emi Marinez - 14 pts - I don't even want to talk about this guy... (look at my A League team..)
- ZachA: Joao Pedro - 7 pts - Looks like after what, 5 games without a shot on target the guy decided he can score for fun again. Or maybe Wolves is dire?

Halfway through November and I sit on top of the Manager of the Month table by just 3 PF over Divya and ZachA!

<br/>

In terms of form, John uses his draw to take top spot with an undefeated 13 points earned out of 15! Just behind him sit ZachA, myself, and Chris each with 12 points in the same timespan!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 4 matchup between Chris and John! Other interesting matchups include a matchup between high scorers ZachA and Mack, Travis hoping to put together back to back wins with a match against Cara, and a Gribbins derby between Divya and myself! Full matchups are as follows:

- Divya (9) vs Matthew (1)
- Morgs (6) vs Andrew (8)
- Travis (12) vs Cara (10)
- Emma (11) vs Alex (5)
- ZachA (2) vs Mack (7)
- Chris (3) vs John (4)

Shoutout this week to John for extending his unbeaten run to 5 games(4W1D)! Abd also to ZachA for 3 wins in a row, and myself and Divya for picking up back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to our Winter Cup this year, the Boxing Day Bash! No, unfortunately this tournament is not named because the final occurs on Boxing Day (although that would be a great idea... if only I thought of that earlier), but for the sentiment of bashing the Premier League for only putting _1 game_ on what was the (maybe the) best day of the year for watching Premier League in years past!

Also, sorry for the late announcement, _usually_ I'd get this out before the first gameweek, but things came up and I didn't realize we'd need 2 whole weeks of November.

Anyway, this format will look slightly familiar since we are cramming it into just 9 weeks! Starting with a rather lengthy 5 week group stage, then heading straight into a 3 week, single elimination bracket to close out the year! If you haven't done the math yet, that means we will be splitting into two groups of 6, then playing each other once! Then, the bottom 2 will be eliminated from each group, leaving the remaining 8 managers to compete in the quarter finals! And as usual, the prize is $30 and a mystery kit (and supreme bragging rights)!

Group A for this tournament has been drawn to be:

- Matthew
- John
- Alex
- Andrew
- Divya
- Travis

And Group B contains:

- ZachA
- Chris
- Morgs
- Mack
- Cara
- Emma

And the first round of matches this week will see:

Group A

- Matthew vs Travis
- John vs Divya
- Alex vs Andrew

Group B

- ZachA vs Morgs
- Chris vs Emma
- Mack vs Cara

Good luck with the first round and welcome to the Boxing Day Bash group stage!

(and yes, The League (tm) _will_ resume on Gameweek 20, so as soon as this tournament ends the one from earlier this season will pick back up!)

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Mack, Chris, MatthewR, Scott
Fell off: Chris

10 - Mack (-3) - League B - The streak of poor luck for Mack's team sees her hanging on by a thread here as Semenyo missed a penalty, Dan Burn picked up a red card, and Guehi vanished the night before a 0-0 match against Brighton. Still think she has a good team, but sheesh the bad luck in PA has spread to her players individually it appears.

9 - Kevin (NEW) - League A - Two huge weeks for Kevin forcing my hand here as this one coincided with a rare double 15 pointer from Gusto and Keane. Garnacho also seems to be good or maybe it's just Wolves?

8 - John (-) - League B - A weird week for John as he picked up a draw in B league off the back of the Emi Martinez 14 pointer. That said, Paqueta is suspended next week and Gabriel is out for 1-2 months minimum so he's going to need some Mateta points if Emi isn't going to save a pen every week.

7 - ZachA (+2) - League B - Another Chelsea clean sheet another (+) for Zach as this time Mbeumo and Joao Pedro joined the party. The former looks to be back to his old Brentford ways and the latter looks to be back to his gameweek 1-4 ways.

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - I'm sorry y'all are gonna have to see my rants about my own team until I inevitably get so unbelievably unlucky I am forced to yoink myself off the list but wtaf. Semenyo missed pen (saved by my keeper who is _on the bench_), Pope subbed before the opportunity to save a pen, dropped Cullen (10 points) and Florentino (4 points) after they produced jack for me. Plus, in the last 5 weeks y'all are averaging 49 points per week against me (245 PA) with the next highest in A league being 45.4 (227 PA).

5 - Zach (+1) - League A - Zach's been making his way up this list with very consistent scoring, with a low score of just 32 this season and 8/11 weeks at 38+. Saka looks to be back to his usual ways, Trossard has been immense, and somehow Casemiro is scoring points, so I guess the poles have reversed.

4 - Luke (+1) - League A - Luke won a match he needed to win this week against Dylan in emphatic fashion, with Mitchell getting his _3rd_ defcon of the season, his midfield doing nothing, and Thiago carrying.

3 - Dylan (-) - League A - Unfortunately for Luke, he does still need ~50 PF to pass Dylan, and so Dylan stays in his place even with the head to head loss and an average week. Surely the goat Welbeck doesn't play such a stout defense such as Crystal Palace's every week. RIP Gabriel though, that's a huge blow.

2 - Darryan (-1) - League A - The power rankings are a fickle fellow as a 20 pointer just isn't enough to keep Darryan in the top spot. Maybe if he played the 28 points on his bench it would be different, but you gotta trust in Liverpool's keeper vs Haaland, Onana against Bournemouth, and superior goal threat Daniel Ballard against a weak defense such as Arsenal's.

1 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Back on top with the double Crystal Palace clean sheet and double from Thiago. Add onto that apparently Anderson takes pens now? And wait - Nottingham Forest can score now? Surely Chris Wood returns any day now.

Good luck all!
