Hello everyone and welcome to Gameweek 14! This week had a quick turnaround since we have games tomorrow, so waivers were due this morning and free agency is open! Highlights from this week include Emma putting up 50 points to Mack's 37, John defeating ZachA 39-25, and Cara upsetting Morgs 32-20. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 47-26 Chris
- John 39-25 ZachA
- Mack 37-50 Emma
- Alex 31-26 Travis
- Cara 32-20 Morgs
- Andrew 11-25 Divya

<br/>

Looking at the table, my lead stays at 8 points as John's victory takes him into 2nd over ZachA. Just 1 point behind Zach sits Chris and Morgan (still), who have been newly joined by Alex. Cara's win sees her move just 2 points behind the trio, ahead of Mack by 1 point. Just below sit Emma and Divya, whose wins took them above Andrew this week.

Time for game changers!

- Matthew: Igor Thiago - 13 pts - This guy just can't stop scoring with his 3rd 13th pointer and 11th goal of the season. Haaland who?
- John: Bruno Fernandes - 11 pts - Idk if United is back but at the very least this guy is, with 5 assists in the last 6 weeks as Crystal Palace finally lose at home.
- Emma: Phil Foden - 15 pts - Huge week for us Foden owners as he finally does something again. Strangely dicey for a City vs Leeds game though.
- Alex: Dango Ouattara - 12 pts - The penalty winning merchant strikes again with probably his 3rd or 4th of the season? Oh and also he scored a goal to keep his hot run going.
- Cara: Cody Gakpo - 14 pts - Liverpool finally found a result this week... against one of the worst teams in the league. But hey, they didn't even sub Salah in so maybe Slot is learning?
- Divya: Bukayo Saka - 5 pts - Hey, you only have to put up more points than the person you're against. That said, great assist by Saka this weekend.

Congrats to John for winning November Manager of the Month (as I am ineligible)! That makes it back to back wins!

In terms of form, John of course takes the top spot with 13/15 points earned! And I am the only manager on 12/15!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what could be a key matchup in the promotion race between Chris and Alex! Elsewhere, John looks to keep his momentum going against Mack, ZachA looks to bounce back with a win against Cara, and Morgs has a match against me to look forward to. Full matchups are as follows:

- Morgs (5) vs Matthew (1)
- Travis (12) vs Divya (10)
- Emma (9) vs Andrew (11)
- Chris (4) vs Alex (6)
- John (2) vs Mack (8)

Shoutout this week to John for going 7 matches unbeaten (6W1D)! Also shoutouts to myself for 4 in a row, Emma for going 3 matches unbeaten (2W1D), and Cara for putting together back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Welcome to week 3 of the Boxing Day Bash! This week saw some great matches, headlined by the narrow 26-25 victory by Travis over Divya in Group A! Elsewhere, Cara picked up her first 3 points in Group B from a 32-25 win over ZachA, and Emma joined Mack at the top of Group B with a 50-20 win against Morgs. Full results are as follows:

- Divya 25-26 Travis

Group B

- ZachA 25-32 Cara
- Chris 26-37 Mack
- Morgs 20-50 Emma

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by two (nearly) must-win matches in Group B in ZachA vs Mack and Chris vs Morgs as the first of each match is staring down an 0-3 start to the group stage should they lose this week. In Group A the matchup to watch will be Alex vs Travis, with both managers on 3 points and looking to make their position that much safer on 6. Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew vs Divya
- John vs Andrew
- Alex vs Travis

Group B

- ZachA vs Mack
- Chris vs Morgs
- Cara vs Emma

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): MatthewR, Kevin, Matt
Fell off: Morgs

10 - John (-) - League B - Another pretty decent week from John keeps him on this list while he ascends to 2nd in League B. Fernandes seems to be picking up consistent points now, Mateta proves that despite his inconsistencies he _can_ score a pen sometimes, and Paqueta is back to his old ways. Can't teach an old dog new tricks I suppose.

9 - Scott (NEW) - League A - A big week from Scott (58 pts) forces my hand as I have deja vu in mentioning Bruno Fernandes. Anyway, recent weeks have seen some incredible pop offs from this team: De Cuyper this week (and Bruno, and Wilson), Eze last, Neto the week before that leading the team.

8 - ZachA (-1) - League B - The epic highs and lows of Chelsea + Newcastle football. Up when they get clean sheets, down when they don't. Anyway, with the Sarr injury Zach's team is looking _awfully_ red, plus he's got Mbeumo off to afcon shortly. Chalobah is killing it though.

7 - Mack (+1) - League B - She can't buy a league win to save her life (went against the highest score in League B this week), but she's got consistent point-getters in Andersen, Collins, Guehi (except against United apparently), Casemiro, and Wieffer, if only Semenyo didn't have Evanilson ahead of him... Anyway, she's got the 2 tallest guys in the Premier League so surely her bad luck won't go on much longer.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - Look at me not even overreacting to my team somehow winning a close match (!!) Anyway my guys keep trying to sabotage me by getting randomly injured (Murillo...) or being subbed off at 59' (Palhinha...) or being subbed on 11 defcon (Tielemans...) but I'm not salty because turns out getting just two more PF can in fact backfire.

5 - Darryan (-1) - League A - Haaland hasn't scored in **two** whole games and thus Darryan must slip a little further down the (power ranking) ladder. Even still, he's got a _lot_ of guys with 4 or 5 points. If only Arsenal could've kept a clean sheet against 10 man Chelsea.

4 - Zach (+1) - League A - 4th in the league and 4th in the rankings off the back of a solid 5 at the back performance. Again a lot of 4 and 5s but Saka and Rogers definitely are high ceiling players and that's 2 starting City defenders (for now). Just needs to figure out that FWD spot...

3 - Dylan (-1) - League A - The 2nd place spot is a fickle one as Dylan's performance this week was heavily influenced by Dango Unchained. Plus, who knows if the Salah benching is good or bad for the 8 time 200+ point scorer. Only time will tell I guess.

2 - Luke (+1) - League A - Let's just say it's not easy to beat me by single digit points where we're both in the 40s twice. Jokes aside another solid week from Luke with Gakpo saving his countryman's job, Thiago continuing to kill it, and a Woltemade goal disguising the array of 1 pointers across his board. Also Palmer saw the bench for the first time in something like 8 weeks.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - And somehow my teams are intrinsically linked, scoring the same number of points for the 2nd time this season. Kudus looks like maybe the only bright spot on Spurs, Anderson's 4+ point streak continues to 4 weeks, and Evanilson could have done a lot better than 5 points. Plus, who knows if the Salah benching is good or bad for the 8 time 200+ point scorer. Only time will tell I guess.

Good luck all!
