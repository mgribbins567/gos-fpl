Happy gameweek 6 of the Short n' Sweet cup and welcome to the semi finals! This week saw our quarterfinals finish up, with the highlight of the week being MatthewR narrowly making it past Luke 44-41. On the other side of the bracket, Darryan picked up his own 4th win of the tournament in a close 31-26 match against Zach. Onto the full results!

**Left Side**

- MatthewR 44-41 Luke
- Matt 33-22 Soph

<br />

- MatthewR vs Matt

<br />

**Right Side**

- Kevin 45-31 Gavin
- Darryan 31-26 Zach

<br />

- Kevin vs Darryan

<br />

The left side matchup should be an interesting one as we see our #1 and #2 teams face off! And on the other side we see Kevin, who sits on top of the form table sorted by PF, take on Darryan, who had a dominant group stage performance and is hoping to remediate his league position with this deep cup run.
