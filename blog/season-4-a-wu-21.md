Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 21! Another quick turnaround (before a 9 day break) since there are midweek matches starting Tuesday so free agency is already open! Some great matchups this week headlined by the first League A draw coming from a match between Darryan and Matt that ended 43-all! Elsewhere, MatthewR continues the trend of defeating Gavin when he puts up a solid score with his 51-46 win, Kevin upset Zach 45-28, and Luke defeated Jesse in a Thiago-led 41-35 victory. Full results are as follows:

- Dylan 44-30 Matthew
- Luke 41-35 Jesse
- Matt 43-43 Darryan
- MatthewR 51-46 Gavin
- Scott 21-34 Coop
- Kevin 45-28 Zach

<br/>

Changes all across the table this week as Darryan takes the top spot in the table by a point following his draw! Just 1 point behind him sits Zach joined by MatthewR following his win. Dylan sees himself rise up the table 3 points behind the duo, with Kevin and Luke joining Jesse on 33 points. I now sit solely on 30 points, 6 ahead of Scott and Coop.

Game Changers!

- Dylan: Brian Brobbey - 9 pts - A fitting game changer for Dylan this week as the Sunderland striker picked up his 3rd goal of the season to secure a 1-1 draw away at Tottenham.
- Luke: Igor Thiago - 17 pts - Yet another huge week from Thiago as he notched his first Premier League hat trick to take his tally to 14 goals on the season. And I heard Everton at home was a difficult fixture?
- Matt: Bruno Guimaraes - 10 pts - The 10 point merchant strikes again with his second 10 pointer in a row and 5th of the season to pick up a huge draw for Matt and 2-0 win for Newcastle.
- MatthewR: Enzo Fernandez - 11 pts - Some Season 3 magic for MatthewR as Enzo takes 3 kicks at the ball to score from 2 yards out and deny Manchester City all 3 points.
- Coop: Nathan Collins - 10 pts - The Brentford center back turned attacker this week with a goal and assist. Who does he think he is, Michael Keane?
- Kevin: Malick Thiaw - 17 pts - His 2nd 16+ return this season, this time off the back of a goal, clean sheet, all 3 bonus, and 17 defensive contributions. Honestly what a signing by Newcastle, maybe it’s a blessing they missed out on their first 6 options.

Just 1 week into January and MatthewR has taken the lead on PF! Kevin, Dylan, and Luke are all just behind on 40+ PF!

In terms of form, Kevin now sits alone at the top of the table with 12/15 points earned! He is most closely followed by Darryan with 10/15!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a match between two teams fully in the mix in Jesse vs Dylan! Elsewhere, I will take on Kevin, Darryan faces off against Luke, and Gavin goes up against Matt! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (8) vs Kevin (5)
- Zach (2) vs Scott (9)
- Coop (10) vs MatthewR (3)
- Gavin (12) vs Matt (11)
- Darryan (1) vs Luke (7)
- Jesse (6) vs Dylan (4)

Shoutouts this week go to Coop and MatthewR for picking up 3 wins in a row each! Also to Dylan for back to back wins!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Alex, Matt, Luke
Fell off: None

10 - John (-3) - League B - Last 5: 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W) - Yep, that's 5 wins in his last 5, but he's seeing some cracks starting to form with DCL unable to score in back to back games, Mateta pulling off his usual disappearing act, and Gabriel being the only one to return. On top of that, KLP seems in and out of the starting 11, Everton's defense is evidently _not_ impenetrable, and O'Reilly's CS odds surely will suffer following the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias. That said, Bruno Fernandes is back soon, which is enormous for John's team. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the coming weeks.

9 - Emma (-3) - League B - Last 5: 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W), 50 (W), 28 (L) - Maybe a bit harsh for a (-3) after one off week, but she will be seeing the direct impacts of the Ruben Dias injury and more and more of her team is transitioning to the injury table or the bench. On the other hand though, Wirtz has been killing it recently, Trossard spent ~2/3 of the game on the bench resting up for the midweek match, and Foden could drop a 15 pointer at a moment's notice.

8 - Mack (+2) - League B - Last 5: 28 (L), 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W) - A solid last 4 for Mack as she slowly climbs up the League B table off the back of consistent performances from Collins, Casemiro, Miley, and Garner. Some solid defenders who consistently get defcon too... if only Gyokeres could score.

7 - Chris (+2) - League B - Last 5: 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W) - And the League B chain continues with the Declan Rice owner! On top of that, Reijnders decided to show up again for the _Festive Fixtures_, Xhaka continues his signing of the season level performances, and Harry Wilson is the next Messi. Solid 63 pointer for Chris this week.

6 - Kevin (+2) - League A - Last 5: 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W) - Really interesting tidbit here is that Kevin has now scored exactly 45 points 4 times this season. There are only 9 instances of 45 being scored in League A. Is there some sort of statistical probability that having a certain combination of returns makes you more likely to score _exactly_ 45 points? Maybe he continues to get 15+ point returns from his players and then a bunch of 2s, 0s, and 1s? Why is he never scoring in the low 40s? It's either 33-36 or 45 (or 50+). Just baffling and I don't have the statistics degree or mental energy to deduce this at 11pm at night. Maybe I'll write a theorem tomorrow to figure out how he does this. Anyway, nice week buddy.

5 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Last 5: 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L) - I'll continue using this as a platform to hate and overrate my team because honestly I know a lot of you guys just ctrl-f your name and see what I have to say about you. Anyway I would've done much better had Gakpo not hit the post and scored while offside, and if Wissa was like 2 inches less wide than he is. Or maybe if Mateta or Foden could actually do something every once in a while that would be nice. Anyway Gakpo did score and had a lot of chances so I'm not too upset with a loss. It was bound to happen.

4 - MatthewR (+1) - League A - Last 5: 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W) - Gavin didn't deserve this one bro... an Enzo Fernandez goal in the 94th minute to not only send Gavin into the shadow realm (930 PA btw) but also cause Darryan to salvage a _draw_ against Matt. Anyway, Watkins good, Odegaard good, Van de Ven good.

3 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Last 5: 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W) - Interesting what happens when I trust my gut and randomly sign _Vitaly Janelt_ who went on to get 2 assists and defcon. Maybe I should do that more often in League A. Anyway, solid performance to reconcile some of the past weeks' losses. Evanilson on the scoresheet (shoutout Gabriel), Anderson defcons away, Rogers gets an assist, and even Bart got a clean sheet.

2 - Zach (-1) - League A - Last 5: 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L) - Rough one this week for Zach as not only does he drop his first score in the 20s this season but he also loses Gvardiol to a broken leg bone (or somewhere in his ankle maybe? nobody posted the xray in the discord). Anyway his normal guys all did pretty well with Saka getting an assist off the bench, Rogers getting an assist while starting, and Casemiro somehow being Zach's best player and consistently being able to get points against some of the worst teams in the league. That said, he needs some of his other guys to show up (and maybe for Ekitike to not be injured... and be better than Gakpo at playing up top).

1 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Last 5:46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D) - You know what, 5 weeks at 40+ with a loss and a draw is quite a bit unlucky, especially when this week Evanilson's goal looms on the bench. But, weird circumstances turning a loss into a draw is what happens when you're at the top of the table. And that one point could make a difference. Also, a really interesting spread of point scorers from Darryan this week, a goal from Aaronson and Rutter, defcon from Xhaka, Cherki, and Rodri, an assist from Raul. Really a team effort to disappoint Matt. Well done taking top spot off the back of that.

Good luck all!
