Hello everyone, happy Thanksgiving and welcome to gameweek 13! Waivers this week are due at 5:30am PST / 8:30am EST on Friday! Highlights this week include a barnburner match between Travis and Cara that ended 22-24 in Cara's favor, a narrow upset for Emma over Alex 33-29, and two high scoring matches as I defeated Divya 67-47 and Mack picked up 3 points in her win over ZachA, 58-41. <span class="small">also morgs won 48-21 against andrew</span> Full results are as follows:

- Divya 47-67 Matthew
- Morgs 48-21 Andrew
- Travis 22-24 Cara
- Emma 33-29 Alex
- ZachA 41-58 Mack
- Chris 26-35 John

<br/>

Lots of changes across the table as only 3 managers do not move! Starting at the top, my lead increases to 8 points over second place ZachA (okay that's 2 that haven't moved). ZachA is joined by John on 22 points with his win, leapfrogging Chris, who Morgs has made company with on 21 points. Mack also moves up in the table, passing Alex on PF at 18 points. Just below Alex on 16 points sits Cara, who passed Andrew this week. The latter of whom is joined by Divya and now Emma, who has skipped between the two on PF.

Game changers!

- Matthew: Morgan Rogers - 15 pts - Huge week for Morgan Rogers owners as Aston Villa prove Leeds _can_ lose to teams not named Tottenham at home.
- Morgs: Enzo Fernandez - 11 pts - I was promised this guy wouldn't be a goalscorer and yet here he is with his 4th goal in 12 games. At least he isn't getting defcon (which is what _was_ promised). Also, this guy has scored 9, 10, 11, and 12 points this season, so cross those off the board for future gameweeks.
- Cara: Danny Welbeck - 8 pts - The Welbenaissance continues as Wele scores his 7th goal this season and proves ex-Manchester United players are just better than current ones.
- Emma: Leandro Trossard - 12 pts - Ol' raccoon eyes must have Princess Diaries cheering harder than ever as this guy has been on _fire_ recently. 2g2a in the last 3 games.
- Mack: Eberechi Eze - 20 pts - What a steal 60 million was. And it's even sweeter plucking him from the grasps of Spurs. What a player and what a hat trick.
- John: Neco Williams - 13 pts - He's no 19 defcon Murillo but I guess 13 points from an assist and clean sheet against Liverpool is pretty good too.

With just 1 more week in November, I sit on top of the Manager of the Month table as the only manager with 9 points! But since I can't win the award, currently John is in the lead with 7 points, ahead of Divya, ZachA, and Morgs all on 6!

In terms of form, John takes the top spot with 13/15 points earned! I am the sole manager on 12/15 points!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 3 matchup in John vs ZachA to break the tie! Elsewhere, Andrew takes on Divya in a Gribbins derby, Morgs takes on Cara, and Chris looks to make a push toward the top of the table with a match against me! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (1) vs Chris (4)
- John (3) vs ZachA (2)
- Mack (6) vs Emma (10)
- Alex (7) vs Travis (12)
- Cara (8) vs Morgs (5)
- Andrew (9) vs Divya (11)

Shoutout this week to John for picking up 6 undefeated in a row (5W1D)! Also, shoutout to myself for 3 in a row, Morgs for 2 back to back wins, and Emma for 2 undefeated (1W1D)!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): MatthewR, Scott, Kevin, Divya
Fell off: Kevin

10 - John (-2) - League B - While he is currently the most in-form manager (undefeated in the last 6), it does come with a duo of 35 pointers and the death of Gabriel. That said, he does have Bruno Fernandes, Szoboszlai, and (god bless) Mateta, so surely he won't be stuck in 35-point purgatory forever.

9 - Morgs (NEW) - League B - Morgs makes it back on the list (and at her new highest spot) after back to back 48+ point weeks. Keane looks like one of the best DEF in the game somehow, Crystal Palace defense is cruising, and Enzo is a goalscorer? Plus an insurance policy of Alexander Isak isn't too bad.

8 - Mack (+2) - League B - Swapping spots with John as Mack found herself with a 58 point week off the back of solid performances across the board, topped off by an Eze 20 pointer. And that's with Semenyo and Gyokeres both injured (and big Dan Burn suspended).

7 - ZachA (-) - League B - The B League streak continues as ZachA has another solid week off the back of a Chelsea clean sheet and some solid work by Cherki and Palhinha. Solid team but in a volatile state as the injuries start piling up and the defense is so reliant on Newcastle and Chelsea.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - I mean, I think my team is good, but I don't think I can crack into the top 5 without a few more good weeks and a lesser reliance on... 14 points from Munoz and 17 from Murillo. That said, 52 points with 2 players with 0 minutes on the field seems pretty solid.

5 - Zach (-) - League A - As Luke mentioned in the Discord earlier this week, Zach _might_ have the best team in the league if he has a FWD. Unfortunately though, he doesn't, so he is relying on Ekitike and Beto getting minutes here and there. That said, Tavernier while Kluivert is injured (and Bournemouth seems to be in disarray atm), Rogers and (possibly injured) Trossard in form. Not to mention this is the team that has Saka.

4 - Darryan (-2) - League A - Purely moving him down the list due to his bench situation. Leaving 28 points on the bench last week and 19 this cannot go unnoticed. Still, Cherki seemed a good pickup and he does have Haaland.

3 - Luke (+1) - League A - A solid week again for Luke off the back of a Barnes clinic against Manchester City, even with him leaving 12 on the bench. Marmoush is also back (with limited minutes), Delap is playing, and even though the Woltemade goal well seems to have at least temporarily dried up, he fills out a solid front 3 next to Thiago.

2 - Dylan (+1) - League A - Unlucky to lose this week, but another high 40-pointer for Dylan puts him top of the PF table in both leagues. Minteh has been a beast this season picking up 5 assists in the last 4 weeks, Welbeck is maybe the best striker in the prem, and Richards has only 2 2-pointers this season. Oh and also Salah is there.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - My second team has cut the PF lead owned by Dylan to just 3 with a 67 point week in the B League. Munoz and Rogers went off, Anderson has been in great form, and a forward line of Evanilson and Thiago is pretty good. Oh and also Salah is there.

Good luck all!
