<br/>

A huge week for the table as we see a _4 way tie for 1st_ on 30 points! Zach leads on PF, with Darryan, MatthewR, and Luke all battling it out as well. Dylan drops to 5th, just 3 points off this group and 3 points ahead of Jesse. Jesse himself is 3 points ahead of the group on 21, which is led by me. I am joined by Kevin and Scott. Matt sits 3 off us and Coop another 3 back!

Game changers!

- Matt: Bruno Guimaraes - 10 pts - Bruno proves to be a prudent pickup as he scores in back to back games, this time securing all 3 bonus in Newcastle's 2-1 win against Burnley.
- MatthewR: Robert Sanchez - 10 pts - Interestingly enough, the high octane offenses of Bournemouth and Chelsea could not crack one another, granting the Chelsea keeper his 7th clean sheet of the season and adding another 10 pointer to the list.
- Scott: Bruno Fernandes - 18 pts - An enormous week from the Portuguese international as he led Manchester United to a 4-1 victory against Wolves with 2 goals and an assist. Maybe Amorim can petition to play Wolves every week?
- Kevin: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall - 16 pts - Every point from the Everton midfielder was needed this week in Kevin's matchup as KDH led his team with a goal, assist, clean sheet, 3 bonus, and 15 defensive contributions as Everton shows Sean Dyche they don't like him that much.
- Zach: Hugo Ekitike - 13 pts - The 1 point chain is broken after 4 weeks of disappointment as the Salah benching finally bears its fruit. Wait, they drew 3-3 against Leeds? nvm...
- Coop: Bryan Mbeumo - 8 pts - Perhaps a parting gift for Coop before afcon as Mbeumo played terribly and scored a goal to lead Coop's team to victory.

One third of the way through December and only two unbeaten managers: Zach and MatthewR! Plenty of the 12th month to go though.

In terms of form, Zach sits on top of the table with 15/15 points earned! Scott and MatthewR sit just behind with 12!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge matchup at the top between Luke and Zach! Elsewhere, MatthewR looks to fend off Scott and Darryan goes up against me! Full matchups are as follows:

- Darryan (2) vs Matthew (7)
- Jesse (6) vs Gavin (12)
- Dylan (5) vs Coop (11)
- Luke (4) vs Zach (1)
- Matt (10) vs Kevin (8)
- MatthewR (3) vs Scott (9)

Shoutout this week to Zach for 5 wins in a row! And also to MatthewR for back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to week 5 and the final week of the Group Stage in the Boxing Day Bash! Some interesting results across the two groups, headlined by the nailbiter in Group A where Coop beat me 37-36. Jesse also picked up his first 3 points with a 43-36 victory over Gavin! Across the stage in Group B, the biggest result sees Scott pick up a win against Darryan 56-38! Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Dylan 32-44 MatthewR
- Jesse 43-36 Gavin
- Matthew 36-37 Coop

These results see MatthewR clinch his spot as the 1 seed from Group A! Myself, Dylan, and Coop all sit on 6 points, with Jesse and Gavin on 3, so still all to play for!

Group B

- Darryan 38-56 Scott
- Luke 37-58 Matt
- Zach 61-44 Kevin

This group remains close as Zach and Matt battle for the 1 seed at 9 points a piece! Scott is the lone manager on 6 points, with Luke and Kevin on 4! Darryan currently sits bottom of the group with 3 points.

That means there are some huge matchups next week, headlined by the head to head for first in Group B between Zach and Matt! Darryan is also in a must-win match against Luke, with the caveat being that he almost definitely will need Scott to lose. Over in Group A, Jesse can stamp his spot in the knockouts if he defeats Dylan by 5 points, and Gavin is still alive if he can find a win against me and see MatthewR defeat Coop (and outscore him). Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Dylan vs Jesse
- MatthewR vs Coop
- Matthew vs Gavin

Group B

- Darryan vs Luke
- Zach vs Matt
- Kevin vs Scott

# Power Rankings

A prenote before my rankings: this week was _weird_ for scores, so I'm putting a lot of managers on the bubble to see if this week is _less weird_ for scores. A big factor in making the power rankings is consistency, so I want to see if the managers at the top of the list continue to have off-weeks, or if it was just, as I said, a _weird_ week.

On the bubble (in no order): John, ZachA, Kevin, Matt, Jesse, Chris, Alex
Fell off: None

10 - Scott (-) - League A - A solid bounce back from Scott off the back of a huge Bruno Fernandes week and De Cuyper being the lucky defender subbed off before his team conceded. That said, Eze's minutes are getting weird, Richarlison and Flemming aren't a pair I would consider consistent, and also maybe a re-arranging of the bench is needed (23 points).

9 - Mack (-2) - League B - Mack has joined me in cursing Evanilson's name as he continues to squander Semenyo's efforts. She does have a well balanced squad in my opinion, especially with Gyokeres back from injury and going up against... Wolves this week. Plus, she has 4 defcon getters on her backline and a couple in midfield to support the aforementioned Ghanaian, Eze, and the other giant on Newcastle.

8 - Matthew (-2) - League A - Yeah why not, let's overreact on my own squad. Half my guys are injured (again) (the other half), Palhinha apparently doesn't start anymore, and guess what Munoz needs surgery. Maybe someone should warn Wissa before he gets too many minutes that he's risking his life.

7 - Emma (+2) - League B - 3 50 pointers in a row for Emma sees her shoot up the rankings. Huge weeks for Manchester City players as Foden picks up his 3rd double digit haul in a row, Trossard continues his great form, and Ruben Dias does Kompany cosplays? She's also got White who is deputizing for an injured Arsenal backline and Reece James who is somehow still uninjured.

6 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - Another big week for the DEF team as this time he gets the :sanchez: 10 pointer and is that another clean sheet due to a sub I see? Anyway, 10 points from his MIDs and FWDs and 34 from the rest of his team is... sustainable. Although maybe leaving the Gordon 10 pointer on the bench was a flex?

5 - Dylan (-2) - League A - It starts getting a bit dicey in the top 5 as Dylan finds himself in ticky tack score hell with only Szoboszlai doing much. That on top of the genuinely real chance that Salah leaves Liverpool in January puts some question marks on if the run of every-other-week 30 pointers will end. That said, he's got Welbeck.

4 - Luke (-) - League A - A slightly better but still under average week from Luke as I look at his team and see a whole lot of red and yellow. I don't think they're too bad (e.g. Fofana should be back I think). He's going to need the Palmer carry to kick in any minute now though, especially with Ndiaye headed to afcon in what 2 gameweeks.

3 - Darryan (+2) - League A - Really difficult to rank these three but I think Darryan just edges it with Saliba coming back from injury (possibly) soon, Calafiori and Timber back, and Cherki playing out of his mind. If only Evanilson had feet and a brain.

2 - Matthew2 (-1) - League B - Suffering from a Salah-shaped hole and suddenly Munoz out for god knows how long. Still, Rogers has looked good, Kudus is maybe the only player on Spurs these days, and Anderson can't stop tackling, so I think I'll be just fine.

1 - Zach (+1) - League A - Fair is fair, a 61 point week will put you on top, even if it's from a Gvardiol 12 pointer and Ekitike scoring his first goal(s) since gameweek 5. Still, there's no injury crisis and 5 mostly solid midfielders so in Tavernier/Rogers/Wieffer/Saka/Trossard and double Manchester City defense (with however much that is worth..)

Good luck all!
