Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 4 and the first international break of the season! Waivers this week are due on Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This is also the first week with full waivers, meaning everyone is available! Also, a quick plug for [gosfpl.com/player-search](https://www.gosfpl.com/player-search) which I've put together to filter and search players (and is a work in progress, especially on mobile). Anyway, highlights this week include Gavin's narrow 40-38 win against me, Darryan's similar 32-30 win over Coop, and Jesse staving off Zach's 40 pointer with 52 points of his own. Full results are as follows:

- Gavin 40-38 Matthew
- Darryan 32-30 Coop
- Jesse 52-40 Zach
- Dylan 48-34 Kevin
- Luke 42-36 Scott
- Matt 27-52 MatthewR

<br/>

This week sees Darryan remain atop the table with his win, just ahead of Dylan and Luke on PF. MatthewR and Jesse follow behind on 6 points, with a whole host of teams on 3.

Now onto the game changers! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to watch too much this weekend, so I'll do my best.

- Gavin: Jack Grealish - Grealish picked up his 3rd and 4th assists of the season this week in Everton's 3-2 win against Wolves for a solid 10 points. Moyesiah > Pep?
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - The 1st overall pick this year picks up his 2nd appearance on this list with his 3rd goal of the season. Nice. 9 points.
- Jesse: Trevoh Chalobah - The Chelsea defense continues returning, this time with Chalobah of all players picking up an 11 pointer from an assist, clean sheet, defensive contribution points, and 2 bonus, to bring his total to 13 for the week.
- Dylan: Dominik Szoboszlai - Coming from right back, the Hungarian scored a beautiful free kick, along with picking up a clean sheet point, 2 defensive contribution points, and 3 bonus to lead Dylan's team with yet another 13 pointer on the list.
- Luke: Tosin Adarabioyo - A solid performance from the stand-in center back as he picked up his own clean sheet and defensive contribution points on his way to a team-high 8 points for Luke off the back of Chelsea's 2-0 win against Fulham.
- MatthewR: Enzo Fernandez - Back to back 1g1a performances for Enzo and double digit hauls as this week he also found a clean sheet point and single bonus point. At this rate he'll have 37g37a this season, surely that's likely.

And as of this week, the August manager of the month has been confirmed, and it is Darryan! He took the win by just 8 PF over Dylan! And there's only 3 gameweeks in September, so good luck all!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top-4 matchup between MatthewR and Luke. Elsewhere, Kevin takes on Jesse, Zach looks to take the first points off of Darryan, and Coop and Gavin battle for their second wins of the season.

- Matthew vs Matt
- MatthewR vs Luke
- Scott vs Dylan
- Kevin vs Jesse
- Zach vs Darryan
- Coop vs Gavin

And lastly, shoutouts to Darryan, Dylan, and Luke for all being on 3 winstreaks! And also to MatthewR, for 2 back to back wins!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 4 of The League(tm) group stage! This week saw a number of great matchups, with the most interesting probably being the 42-all draw between Luke and my team in the B league. Elsewhere, John took an impressive victory over Gavin 50-40 and Zach narrowly defeated Travis 40-37. Also, this week was heavily weighted toward League A, with the left side only losing 2 and drawing 1 (out of 12 matches). Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 38-71 ZachA
- Luke 42-42 Matthew2
- MatthewR 52-26 Andrew
- Gavin 40-50 John
- Darryan 32-22 Emma
- Kevin 34-22 Divya
- Dylan 48-35 Mack
- Jesse 52-24 Alex
- Matt 27-21 Chris
- Coop 30-23 Cara
- Scott 36-28 Morgs
- Zach 40-37 Travis

As for the table, only 2 undefeated teams left in MatthewR and Jesse! Following them is a whole host of teams on 6 points! Still plenty of games left to play in this group stage though so anything can happen!

Next week should have some fun ones though, headlined by our first Zach derby! Elsewhere, Gavin faces off against Chris in what could be an entertaining matchup, Coop looks to take on Andrew, and Alex hopes to replicate his result this week against Darryan. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Travis
- Luke vs Morgs
- MatthewR vs Cara
- Gavin vs Chris
- Darryan vs Alex
- Kevin vs Mack
- Dylan vs Divya
- Jesse vs Emma
- Matt vs John
- Coop vs Andrew
- Scott vs Matthew2
- Zach vs ZachA

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Travis, Chris, Alex, Gavin
Fell off: Chris, Alex

Prefacing this ranking by saying that 8-10 were definitely not easy to pick lol.

10 - Dylan (NEW) - League A - Considering he is 3-0 in the league and 2-1 in the cup, I think it's fair to put Dylan on this list. However, I do think his defenders need to do some heavy lifting with the absolutely dire FWD situation on his team. And considering he is in 3rd, I'm not sure if many of the sought after FWDs will drop to him on waivers.

9 - Jesse (NEW) - League A - Another team in a weird state that I don't really know how to rank, Jesse lives and dies by Manchester City's performance. Certainly he gets minus points for the Cherki, Ben White, and Sarr injuries, but Isak should be getting minutes for Liverpool soon, so it evens out maybe?

8 - Zach (-3) - League A - Unfortunately for Zach, the freefall continues, with Aston Villa not scoring in August, Trafford losing his starting spot with the Donnarumma signing, and Saka/Gvardiol being who-knows-where. Add on the Guehi drama at Crystal Palace and I worry for his team moving forward. That said, Ekitike should get a few more starts and he seems to be finding solid scores these weeks so with how difficult it has been to fill these later slots on the power rankings, he stays.

7 - Mack (-) - League B - Even with the slight off week for Mack considering the random Elanga and Barnes rotation, I think Mack has a top 10 team. Eze picked up his first minutes in an Arsenal shirt, Strand Larsen is back from injury and is no longer contending with the transfer rumor mill, and surely Elanga starts next week, right?

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - What could be better than a 1 point loss in week 2 and a 2 point loss in week 3? Maybe I'm biased but even with the conflicting sources regarding Solanke's injury, the pickups of Kluivert (returning from injury) and Wissa (moving to Newcastle) are pretty big upgrades in the long run. Plus, Jedi is back.

5 - MatthewR (+3) - League A - Had a difficult time rating MatthewR's team this week, especially considering 33 points came from 3 players, but he has come up with the most PF in League A, so obviously something is working.

4 - Luke (-1) - League A - Another solid week for Luke keeps him in the 40+ PF per week range and with Thiago nailed and Barry getting more minutes I think he maybe has a passable (although lower tier) group of FWDs ahead of his midfield. Also, Palmer should be back soon which is huge for him.

3 - Darryan (-1) - League A - Top of League A, 3 good FWDs, and a waiver wire with a plethora of MID options this week has Darryan sit just ahead of Luke in this ranking. The only negatives are Saliba out for 3-4 weeks and Frimpong probably being eased back into the team. The only question is if he can keep winning with 2 pointers from his Arsenal players.

2 - ZachA (+3) - League B - With the highest PF in both leagues and an enormous 71 point week, ZachA has given me no choice but to push him further and further up the power rankings. And that's despite my distaste for the 25 points from his Chelsea DEF/GKP corps. That said, his bald midfielder is off the mark, Sarr is the Crystal Palace talisman with Eze gone (despite his injury seeming pretty bad), Wilson getting minutes, and Pedro being the undisputed number 9 at Chelsea with the Delap injury.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Back to form this week with a 42 pointer with only 7 points coming from a midfield of Salah, Rogers, and Kudus. Evanilson picked up his first goal of the season, Thiago no longer has a Wissa-shaped shadow behind him, and surely Salah scores against Burnley?

Good luck and I hope you enjoyed the international break!
