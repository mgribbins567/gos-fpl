Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 19! Waivers this week were due this morning (probably, I'm currently writing this on an airplane so I honestly am not sure when this will be sent out) since there are games tomorrow! Highlights from this week include a 37-34 upset from Emma as she hands me my 3rd defeat in the last 4 weeks, Chris put up a week high 60 points against Morgs' 30, and Cara took a close match against Alex 44-38! Full results are as follows:

- Emma 37-34 Matthew
- ZachA 39-30 Travis
- Chris 60-30 Morgs
- John 31-25 Divya
- Mack 46-22 Andrew
- Alex 38-44 Cara

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, a rare week with no movement, but lots of gaps being closed across the table, starting at the top as my lead has fallen to just 2 points over John! Behind him by 6 points are the trio of Chris, ZachA, and Emma. They currently have a 4 point gap above Alex, who is only above Morgs on PF. They are being chased by Cara, who is only back by 1 now, and Mack, who is another 2 behind her.

Onto the game changers!

- Emma: Florian Wirtz - 10 pts - The German is off the mark with his first goal and a huge 10 points to lead Emma to 3 points against me.
- ZachA: Rayan Cherki - 13 pts - How Manchester City got this guy for just 30 million I don't know. Hopefully Pep doesn't coach the fun out of him.
- Chris: Ollie Watkins - 12 pts - Watkins is back?? Just had to start on the bench for him to figure out how to score I guess. Or maybe Emery figured out Chelsea to get their _11th_ win in a row.
- John: Raul Jimenez - 9 pts - Somehow Fulham have turned things around and picked up yet another win and clean sheet, this one coming from the ever-present Mexican striker.
- Mack: Martin Dubravka - 11 pts - Still not sure this game was actually played, but the Burnley keeper got 11 points so that's cool.
- Cara: Kevin Schade - 20 pts - Who needs Dango when the 6.5 foot tall German guy can score a hat trick that I don't think had a memorable goal in it?

Going into the final gameweek of December, Emma keeps her spot at the top of the table! At this point, only John at 12 points can catch her (should she lose this week).

The form table is, of course, the same as the Manager of the Month table this week. So I won't write anything else about it. Here it is though:

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by what should be an interesting one between me and Alex! Elsewhere, Mack looks to gain at least 1 league position with a match against Cara, Morgs faces off against ZachA in what could be a big one in closing the gap on the leading group, and Travis goes up against Emma! Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (1) vs Alex (6)
- Cara (8) vs Mack (9)
- Andrew (11) vs John (2)
- Divya (10) vs Chris (3)
- Morgs (7) vs ZachA (4)
- Travis (12) vs Emma (5)

Shoutouts this week go to Emma for her 8 undefeated streak (7W1D)! Also to John for 4 wins in a row, Chris for 4 unbeaten (3W1D), and Cara for 2 (1W1D)!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Cara, Chris, Alex, Mack, Matt
Fell off: Matt

10 - Chris (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 52 (W), 51 (W), 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W) - A huge week for Chris as he continues his good form off the back of the legend Ollie Watkins himself. And that's with a solid supporting cast (of which he saw _a lot_ of returns this week) between defcon beat Tarkowski (who apparently did play a match this week), the only good Spurs defender, and midfielders including the 2nd highest scorer (Rice), defcon beast Xhaka, and this year's best RW (Wilson).

9 - Scott (-1) - League A - Last 5: 25 (L), 56 (W), 59 (W), 28 (L), 42 (L) - Honestly not a bad performance this week, but considering 17 points are from Patrick Dorgu I worry about the coming few as Bruno Fernandes recovers, Amad made the knockouts at afcon, and Eze has vanished into thin air. That said, Neto and Wilson have been solid, Richarlison could have had 2 goals if the offside rule didn't exist, and Everton and Liverpool have a pretty solid run of games (defensively).

8 - John (-2) - League B - Last 5: 36 (L), 74 (W), 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W) - The answer is yes, 31 points is enough to keep you on the power rankings this week. It isn't every gameweek you see someone roll out the 523 so my presumption is with Szoboszlai unflagged and Grealish/KDH returning soonish(?), the 4 points midfield from just Anton Stach is a temporary thing. Also, Raul and DCL especially have been cooking and Gabriel is back, so surely the #2 team in League B will be just fine.

7 - Emma (-2) - League B - Last 5: 50 (W), 57 (W), 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W) - Normally I wouldn't drop someone too many spots for a 37 point week, so this one is more about other managers performing well rather than Emma doing poorly. After all, Wirtz figured out that scoring will do a hell of a lot better than 'passing the eye test' to silence the haters, Tottenham kept a clean sheet (away from home, of course), and Reece James has maybe the longest point breakdown list I've ever seen for just a 6 pointer.

6 - Kevin (+3) - League A - Last 5: 33 (L), 44 (W), 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W) - Kevin's team has once again figured out what it's like to score points, with Gravenberch, Keane, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin leading his charge up the table. Imagine naming the 3 of them at the beginning of the season as key players in week 19.

5 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - Last 5: 52 (W), 44 (W), 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W) - Of course I'm obligated to let MatthewR ride the wave of the highest score of the season up a couple spots. Yeah, it's from a Schade 20 pointer, a first goal of the season from Odegaard, a 32 minute appearance from Watkins that resulted in a brace, and (somehow least surprisingly of the 4) a 11 point week from Van de Ven. Maybe next week he'll start Dubravka though to try for the 85 pointer.

4 - Matthew (-) - League A - Last 5: 64 (W), 36 (L), 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W) - My team's still trucking away around 40, this time from yet another Semenyo goal (while he remains at Bournemouth), Tielemans nearly setting the 12 defcon land speed record (and also getting an assist), and Antonee Robinson being the prince that was promised when I drafted him. If only I could win some close matchups (maybe Gakpo could help with that?).

3 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 54 (W), 38 (L), 46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W) - Somehow Darryan survives an inexplicable triple 0 pointer from his defenders from 0 flagged players, plus a Rutter own goal. I guess Cherki, Xhaka, and Raul Jiminez are pretty good. And that's with Haaland returning a solid 2 points.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Last 5: 52 (W), 33 (L), 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L) - Certainly an off week, but that's how things go and based on the rest of this season, I should score 42+ this week. Praying Dango comes back soon so Thiago can finally score some pens again.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 53 (W), 61 (W), 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L) - This guy also has Rogers and Kerkez so the scores are looking _pretty_ similar. The main difference being he got his points from Gvardiol, Saka, and Ekitike and I got mine from _Mykolenko, Leno, and Thiago_. Wonder who will be better off in the long run?

Good luck all!
