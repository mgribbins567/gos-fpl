Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 12! I hope y'all had a great international break and I'm sorry to the Gabriel owners out there for your loss o7. Waivers this week are due Friday at 3:00am PDT / 6:00am EDT! Highlights from this week include an absurd 67-55 match between Kevin and Coop in which the former picked up the 3 points, a big upset win for MatthewR over Darryan 39-20, and Luke defeating Dylan by a score of 47-34. Full results are as follows:

- Zach 48-29 Matthew
- Coop 55-67 Kevin
- Gavin 28-42 Scott
- Darryan 20-39 MatthewR
- Jesse 39-31 Matt
- Dylan 34-47 Luke

<br/>

Looking over at the table, Dylan takes 1st on PF over Darryan, joined now by Luke on 24 points. Jesse and MatthewR keep pace just 3 points back. Zach follows them by a match, with Kevin moving up a spot and occupying 15 points alone. Further down the table, there is a traffic jam on 12 points as myself, Coop, Matt, and Scott all sit in sad competition on PF.

And now, onto the game changers!

- Zach: Bukayo Saka - 12 pts - A big week for Zach and Saka as he picked up a goal and his 2nd defcon of the season in Arsenal's 2-2 draw against rival title contenders Sunderland.
- Kevin: Malo Gusto - 15 pts - With dual 15-pointers this week the Chelsea defender just beats Keane on BPS off the back of Chelsea's 3-0 win against Wolves in which he picked up a goal, clean sheet, and all 3 bonus.
- Scott: Pedro Neto - 9 pts - Another Blue on this list, Neto scored what I seem to recall being a tap in which was somehow enough to get him 1 bonus point.
- MatthewR: Kevin Schade - 8 pts - The tall German defeated the other tall German by leading his team to a 3-1 victory from his goal and bonus point for a total of 8 for MatthewR.
- Jesse: Jeremy Doku - 11 pts - I'm not sure if 11 points describes just how well Doku played in this game, but he scored a brilliant goal and deservedly earned all 3 bonus points as Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-0.
- Luke: Igor Thiago - 13 pts - Whoever said the Belgian league is weak is holding their tongue as the brand new Brentford striker picked up his _8th_ goal this season with a brace against Newcastle and all 3 bonus points.

Halfway through November and Kevin sits at the top with an ungodly 124 PF! He is above Scott and MatthewR, who also have 6 points.

In terms of form, Zach and MatthewR take the top spots with 12/15 points earned across the last 5!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a matchup between two in-form teams in Darryan and Kevin! Elsewhere, I take on Coop in another recently-unlucky-off and Dylan faces off against MatthewR in what should be an interesting one! Full matchups are as follows:

- Coop (9) vs Matthew (8)
- Gavin (12) vs Zach (6)
- Darryan (2) vs Kevin (7)
- Jesse (4) vs Scott (11)
- Dylan (1) vs MatthewR (5)
- Luke (3) vs Matt (10)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 4 winstreak and Scott for 3 in a row! Also, to Kevin for picking up back-to-back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to our Winter Cup this year, the Boxing Day Bash! No, unfortunately this tournament is not named because the final occurs on Boxing Day (although that would be a great idea... if only I thought of that earlier), but for the sentiment of bashing the Premier League for only putting _1 game_ on what was the (maybe the) best day of the year for watching Premier League in years past!

Also, sorry for the late announcement, _usually_ I'd get this out before the first gameweek, but things came up and I didn't realize we'd need 2 whole weeks of November.

Anyway, this format will look slightly familiar since we are cramming it into just 9 weeks! Starting with a rather lengthy 5 week group stage, then heading straight into a 3 week, single elimination bracket to close out the year! If you haven't done the math yet, that means we will be splitting into two groups of 6, then playing each other once! Then, the bottom 2 will be eliminated from each group, leaving the remaining 8 managers to compete in the quarter finals! And as usual, the prize is $30 and a mystery kit (and supreme bragging rights)!

Group A for this tournament has been drawn to be:

- Dylan
- Jesse
- MatthewR
- Matthew
- Coop
- Gavin

And Group B contains:

- Darryan
- Luke
- Zach
- Kevin
- Matt
- Scott

And the first round of matches this week will see:

Group A

- Dylan vs Gavin
- Jesse vs Coop
- MatthewR vs Matthew

Group B

- Darryan vs Zach
- Luke vs Scott
- Kevin vs Matt

Good luck with the first round and welcome to the Boxing Day Bash group stage!

(and yes, The League (tm) _will_ resume on Gameweek 20, so as soon as this tournament ends the one from earlier this season will pick back up!)

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Mack, Chris, MatthewR, Scott
Fell off: Chris

10 - Mack (-3) - League B - The streak of poor luck for Mack's team sees her hanging on by a thread here as Semenyo missed a penalty, Dan Burn picked up a red card, and Guehi vanished the night before a 0-0 match against Brighton. Still think she has a good team, but sheesh the bad luck in PA has spread to her players individually it appears.

9 - Kevin (NEW) - League A - Two huge weeks for Kevin forcing my hand here as this one coincided with a rare double 15 pointer from Gusto and Keane. Garnacho also seems to be good or maybe it's just Wolves?

8 - John (-) - League B - A weird week for John as he picked up a draw in B league off the back of the Emi Martinez 14 pointer. That said, Paqueta is suspended next week and Gabriel is out for 1-2 months minimum so he's going to need some Mateta points if Emi isn't going to save a pen every week.

7 - ZachA (+2) - League B - Another Chelsea clean sheet another (+) for Zach as this time Mbeumo and Joao Pedro joined the party. The former looks to be back to his old Brentford ways and the latter looks to be back to his gameweek 1-4 ways.

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - I'm sorry y'all are gonna have to see my rants about my own team until I inevitably get so unbelievably unlucky I am forced to yoink myself off the list but wtaf. Semenyo missed pen (saved by my keeper who is _on the bench_), Pope subbed before the opportunity to save a pen, dropped Cullen (10 points) and Florentino (4 points) after they produced jack for me. Plus, in the last 5 weeks y'all are averaging 49 points per week against me (245 PA) with the next highest in A league being 45.4 (227 PA).

5 - Zach (+1) - League A - Zach's been making his way up this list with very consistent scoring, with a low score of just 32 this season and 8/11 weeks at 38+. Saka looks to be back to his usual ways, Trossard has been immense, and somehow Casemiro is scoring points, so I guess the poles have reversed.

4 - Luke (+1) - League A - Luke won a match he needed to win this week against Dylan in emphatic fashion, with Mitchell getting his _3rd_ defcon of the season, his midfield doing nothing, and Thiago carrying.

3 - Dylan (-) - League A - Unfortunately for Luke, he does still need ~50 PF to pass Dylan, and so Dylan stays in his place even with the head to head loss and an average week. Surely the goat Welbeck doesn't play such a stout defense such as Crystal Palace's every week. RIP Gabriel though, that's a huge blow.

2 - Darryan (-1) - League A - The power rankings are a fickle fellow as a 20 pointer just isn't enough to keep Darryan in the top spot. Maybe if he played the 28 points on his bench it would be different, but you gotta trust in Liverpool's keeper vs Haaland, Onana against Bournemouth, and superior goal threat Daniel Ballard against a weak defense such as Arsenal's.

1 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Back on top with the double Crystal Palace clean sheet and double from Thiago. Add onto that apparently Anderson takes pens now? And wait - Nottingham Forest can score now? Surely Chris Wood returns any day now.

Good luck all!
