Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 20, the new year, and the second half of the season! A quick turnaround this week with waivers due tomorrow morning at 3am PST / 6am EST! Some close and high scoring matches across the league this week, headlined by a league-winner type performance from Zach as he somehow rescued a 46-43 win against Matt. Elsewhere, Coop upset Luke in dramatic fashion in a 45-41 match, Dylan found a big 3 points against Gavin 49-42, and Jesse put up a week high 59 to upset Darryan's 42 point week. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 41-27 Scott
- Kevin 27-50 MatthewR
- Zach 46-43 Matt
- Coop 45-41 Luke
- Gavin 42-49 Dylan
- Darryan 42-59 Jesse

<br/>

And heading over to the table, Zach's win (and Darryan's loss) causes yet another swap on PF at the top of the table, with Zach leading! Still just 3 points behind them sits MatthewR. Behind him, Jesse and Dylan break away from the group of 4 that was on 30 points, with my win taking me to the top of the newly created trio on 30 (including myself, Kevin, and Luke). The rest of the table remains the same, other than Coop now sitting level on 21 points with Matt!

Game Changers!

- Matthew: Jean-Philippe Mateta - 9 pts - His first goal in 6 weeks and what a doozy, a header that probably accounted for .9 xG. My goat.
- MatthewR: Enzo Fernandez - 9 pts - Welcome back Enzo with his first goal in 7 weeks to one-up Mateta and help Chelsea to a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth... which got Maresca sacked. What an interesting week for the Blues.
- Zach: Leandro Trossard - 13 pts - Very nearly gave this one to Pep for subbing off O'Reilly, but I guess the 13 pointer from the Belgian winger will have to do because he was on fire with a goal and assist against Aston Villa. Sorry Zach I don't think you're getting a handshake after this one.
- Coop: Jordan Pickford - 10 pts - Everton defense is BACK. Or maybe Nottingham Forest has a lack of Chris Wood problem. Either way Pickford got his second clean sheet in a row and 6 whole saves to lead Coop's upset.
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalhaes - 15 pts - Really a heroic performance from both Gabriel and Mukiele putting up 26 of Dylan's 49 points this week. The former got an interesting goal from a corner and the latter left the field with Haaland in his pocket.
- Jesse: James Garner - 16 pts - The defcon merchant converted to a g/a merchant with a goal, assist, and oh wait yeah he got 19 defensive contributions as well. That's 4 weeks in a row he's had 12+.

Congratulations to Zach for winning December Manager of the Month outright, with 15/18 points earned! This is his second MotM this season!

In terms of form, Zach and Kevin sit on top of the table with 12/15 points earned! A whole slew follows them on 9.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge top half matchup between Dylan and myself! Elsewhere, Luke looks to pick up his form with a match against Jesse, Matt faces off against Darryan, and Kevin looks to pull off an upset against Zach! Full matchups are as follows:

- Dylan (5) vs Matthew (6)
- Luke (8) vs Jesse (4)
- Matt (10) vs Darryan (2)
- MatthewR (3) vs Gavin (12)
- Scott (9) vs Coop (11)
- Kevin (7) vs Zach (1)

Shoutouts this week go to me for my 3 winstreak! And also to Kevin and MatthewR for picking up back to back victories!

# The League

And welcome back to The League (tm)! As a quick reminder to where we left off, we are in the first round of playoffs between the managers who finished 9th to 16th in our group stage table at the beginning of the season! The winners this week will go up against the managers who finished 5th through 8th next week, and then the winners of those matchups will face off against the top 4 managers from the group stage in the quarter finals! That means we will have some great matchups this week across the board, including a top of League B clash between my B team and John, what should be a great matchup between Mack and Alex, and an A League match between MatthewR and Matt! Full matchups are as follows:

- MatthewR vs Matt
- John vs Matthew2
- ZachA vs Andrew
- Mack vs Alex

And as a reminder for the current state of things, here is what the tournament looks like so far!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Kevin, Cara, Chris, Alex
Fell off: Kevin

10 - Mack (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 34 (L), 28 (L), 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W) - After a rough few weeks Mack was able to turn things around with a huge cup run, earning her the Boxing Day Bash trophy for League B and a place back on this list. There's a certain _je ne sais quoi_ to winning a trophy that meant she beat the other 3 or so names I could have put here. Anyway, she's got some very consistent performers as of recently, with Casemiro, Semenyo, Garner, and even Collins performing well week in week out.

9 - Chris (+1) - League B - Last 5: 51 (W), 36 (W), 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W) - Another solid performance and win for Chris off the back of Tarkowski and Van de Ven putting in very respectable performances. On top of that, Xhaka and Watkins look to be the 5 point merchants they were thought to be and even Wilson (the Callum one) is chipping in with a penalty win assist. The Rice injury is concerning, but _surely_ he isn't out too long... right?

8 - Kevin (-2) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 55 (W), 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L) - Sorry Kevin, welcome to being a yo-yo team. Rough time with Thiaw, Gravenberch, and (somehow) Konate being the only players to do anything. Plus, Caicedo is suspended next week, Keane hit his head on a bus door, and KDH and Pau are nowhere to be seen. But hey maybe DCL will be rested enough to stay onside next game?

7 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 74 (W), 47 (W), 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W) - 1st place in League B and playing a 523 due to injuries to Fernandes and KDH. Plus the 2 are both Leeds players, which is kinda wild? Anyway, Gabriel is all you really need to win these days and Mateta's once per two month goal finally happened (let's goooo).

6 - Emma (+1) - League B - Last 5: 57 (W), 42 (W), 35 (W), 37 (W), 50 (W) - With her win this week set the longest win streak of the season in either league! And what a performance it was, despite coming up just a hair short in the Boxing Day Bash final. Trossard is going off, somehow Zirkzee got all 3 bonus from his 45 minute appearance (I'm sorry to anyone who _did not_ hate watch the Manchester United vs Wolves game), and Robertson saw the field long enough to get his 2nd clean sheet of the season. 50 points is 50 points.

5 - MatthewR (-) - League A - Last 5: 44 (W), 23 (L), 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W) - It's no 77 pointer, but 50 points from a grand total of _zero_ double digit returns sounds pretty good. Tarkowski and Enzo made blue jerseys proud, Gordon, Odegaard, and Watkins all enjoyed 5 pointers, and Havertz showed up on the bench so that's a positive. :kai:

4 - Matthew2 (-2) - League B - Last 5: 33 (L), 47 (L), 55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L) - Hey where'd all my points go?? Who knew when Kudus/Rogers/Evanilson/Thiago all do nothing and so do all my other players you end up with averaging _2_ points per player. Nice maybe we'll bounce back next week.

3 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Last 5: 36 (L), 43 (L), 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W) - It looked dicey in places but consistency is nice, especially with the little bit of matchup luck I've been getting recently. Weird scores this week as Mateta was the only player to do anything really, with Wissa picking up a goal (and no bonus), Semenyo an assist, and KLP a clean sheet from winger.

2 - Darryan (+1) - League A - Last 5: 38 (L), 46 (W), 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L) - An unfortunate loss for Darryan but a solid score nonetheless as Timber dodged the CS wipe, Xhaka and Cherki prove they are the two best defensive midfielders in the premier league, and Calafiori benching unleashed a Leeds clean sheet from Bijol, which they got away at Anfield. Interesting.

1 - Zach (-) - League A - Last 5: 61 (W), 66 (W), 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W) - A _little_ fortunate to win this week, but a Trossard 13 and Matheus Nunes 11 will do it. Plus Opta seemed to enjoy Tavernier's performance so why not help him out a little too. Anyway, Gvardiol not starting is a little odd and apparently Rogers needs lower xG chances to be able to score, so Villa should try to get him more of those (for Zach's sake).

Good luck all!
