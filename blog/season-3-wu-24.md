Happy gameweek 24 and welcome to our first double gameweek of the season! That means Liverpool and Everton players will play twice, as those teams make up the game they missed earlier this season! Waivers this week are due Friday at 3:00am PST / 6:00am EST! This week didn't see a lot in terms of close matchups, but did see Matt take a 56-36 upset over MatthewR, my 43-32 win over Zach, and Kevin take a 41-33 victory over Jesse.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 43-32 Zach
- Luke 47-24 Dylan
- Matt 56-36 MatthewR
- Jesse 33-41 Kevin
- Emily 10-31 Rebecca
- Andrew 22-35 Gavin
- Soph 24-61 Darryan
- Coop 36-27 Scott

<br/>

This week sees a good bit of movement across the table! At the top, MatthewR's lead shrinks to just 9 points with Matt's win in the title race 6-pointer, with Kevin still sitting 6 points back. I am just 3 points back of Kevin, moving ahead of Luke and Zach, who sit just 1 point behind me. Gavin's win this week moves him ahead of Jesse by a point and just 3 points off the group at 5-6, and Coop closes the gap on Jesse to just 2 points. Just 3 and 4 points behind Coop sit Rebecca and Darryan, respectively, as their wins take them above Dylan, Soph, and Emily who drop down the table slightly.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week saw some usual names and a couple of new ones!

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - A big week for Bournemouth as they decimate Nottingham Forest 5-0, with Semenyo's contribution being a goal, clean sheet point, and bonus point for 9 FPL points.
- Luke: Dango Ouattara - With the back-to-back Bournemouth hat trick, Dango's 3 goals mirrored Kluivert's week last time out as he picked up 21 points for Luke this week.
- Matt: Erling Haaland - As the robot returns to form with his 6th goal contribution in 5 matches, Matt picks up 12 more points from a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points.
- Kevin: Alexander Isak - In his 4th appearance on this list, the Swede added another 2 goals to his name in Newcastle's dispatch of Southampton 3-1, netting him 13 total points.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - Another regular here (7 apps), Salah's record breaking goal against Ipswich and single bonus point garnered 8 points, leading Rebecca's team.
- Gavin: Jarrad Branthwaite - Another big performance from Moyes's Everton led to a 1-0 win against Brighton and a clean sheet and 2 bonus points for Branthwaite for an 8 point contribution for Gavin.
- Darryan: Cody Gakpo - A huge performance from Cody Gakpo this week as he set up a goal and scored another 2 to pick up 3 bonus points and a huge 16 points.
- Coop: Jacob Ramsey - Ramsey picked up Villa's only goal in a 1-1 draw against West Ham, leading to 3 bonus points and a double digit haul (10) to lead Coop's team.

Congratulations to Kevin for winning January Manager of the Month! He takes it by 40 PF over Gavin who also went undefeated!
