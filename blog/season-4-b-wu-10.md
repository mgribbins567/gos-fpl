Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 10! Waivers this week are due Friday at 6:30am PDT / 9:30am EDT!

Elsewhere, Mack picked up a close victory over Morgs in the Henderson derby, ZachA defeated me by a score of 39-32, and Chris put up a week-high 60 points against Emma's 35. Full results are as follows:

<br/>

Looking at the table, we see Chris and Alex cut my lead to just 3 points this week, with Chris passing the latter on PF for 2nd. ZachA, Mack, and John also find themselves moving up the table, just 2, 3, and 3 points behind Alex. The trio moves ahead of Morgs on PF. The rest of the table remains the same, with Cara and Andrew's draw seeing them remain a consistent 3 points apart.

And now, the game changers!

- ZachA: Bryan Mbeumo - 15 pts - The United homer got to cheer on his own player this week as the bald man netted 2 in Manchester United's 4-2 win against Brighton. Amor-in?
- Chris: Micky van de Ven - 23 pts - You don't often see a 23-pointer, let alone from a center back. Let alone against the giants that are Everton.
- John: Pedro Porro - 11 pts - Oops another Spurs player. Except this one didn't score 2 goals smh.
- Mack: Eberechi Eze - 11 pts - Of course he scores his first goal in the prem against Crystal Palace. Written in the stars.
- Alex: Marcus Tavernier - 11 pts - Hiring Sean Dyche wasn't enough, evidently.
- Andrew: Matheus Cunha - 8 pts - Not quite as good as United's other signing, but still scored. Also, @andrew your whole team is injured somehow.

Congratulations to John for winning October Manager of the Month! He took it on PF over Chris and Mack, who also went undefeated!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): ZachA, MatthewR, Morgs
Fell off: Morgs

10 - John (NEW) - League B - Congratulations to John for making his first appearance on the list! This comes off the back of 3 very solid weeks. Szoboszlai looks like the best player by far on Liverpool, Gabriel has just been immense, and Mateta just keeps racking up xG. He's got a solid team with some in-form players so we'll see how he keeps up.

9 - Alex (-1) - League B - This is the start of some really difficult decisions I had to make in the ranking and unfortunately Alex got dropped a spot, even with a 47 pointer this week. Tavernier and Bruno G came up big and Bowen sure isn't going anywhere even though his team plays some of the worst football I've seen since... last season.

8 - Jesse (-2) - League A - Another decent week that got shifted due to having to sort of _dramatically_ rebalance the rankings. It does kinda work though, because Doku and Reijnders have been falling out of form as Jesse found just 7 points from his 4 playing midfielders.

7 - Zach (+2) - League A - Zach has been on a roll, and even with a slightly worse week than the past couple he picked up his 3rd straight win. A very helpful Tavernier pickup paid off, along with Guehi sneaking in some defcon and his 3 other midfielders all getting 3 pointers, which is interesting. Still, he's come back from his bit of bad (/unlucky) form and has been gaining points fast.

6 - Matthew (-3) - League A - Genuinely, I might have the most temperamental team in the league due to having so many injured players, but this week was rough. The guy who I picked up because he got 18/12/12/16 defcon in the 4 weeks before only got 4 defensive contributions, Murillo only hit 9, Foden has decided to vanish despite playing well, and Munoz and Mateta played Arsenal. So, a tough week for me.

5 - Dylan (+2) - League A - Really another solid week for Dylan with his second 50+ in a row. This time from Dango, Szoboszlai, and Gabriel all pitching in with 9+ pointers. And, he's still winning the Welbeck trade.

4 - Mack (+1) - League B - Not the best week for Mack but a win's a win, especially with 12 points sitting on the bench. Eze has looked solid and has been returning pretty regularly over the past 5 weeks, Guehi is Guehi, and Woltemade has been super solid recently (despite finally breaking his scoring streak). The only question marks are what's going on with Newcastle's MIDs - namely Elanga and Tonali - being benched.

3 - Luke (+1) - League A - Rough week for Luke as well seeing as he was joint lowest scorer across both leagues, but power rankings are a prediction for who will do well and he's coming off 3 wins in a row. Plus, he's got Delap now to make up for getting 6 points from his 4 midfielders.

2 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Similar story to Luke (and Darryan) for this team, as the injuries to Evanilson and Chris Wood hit _hard_. Still an okay enough score, but barely in the 30s is certainly an off week.

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Let's be honest, he's still got Haaland and a bunch of Arsenal defenders - he'll be fine. Unlucky to not get any defcon this week though.

Good luck all!
