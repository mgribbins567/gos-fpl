Happy gameweek 8 of the kickoff cup and welcome to the the semi finals!! Finally, we see some parity in the tournament, as this round saw **no** sweeps! Starting on the left side of the bracket, I overcame a 3 point deficit from the first leg to take the tie 76-68 over Dylan. I will be meeting Zach in the semi final, who overcame his own 2 point deficit to take a commanding 91-74 upset over Matt this round. The right side of the bracket proved much closer, as the total difference between victors and losers in both matchups was just 6 points. In our first quarter final, we saw Scott take a solid 16 point lead over Darryan, but Darryan put up a very solid week, cutting the lead to just 2 points in the tie as Scott just holds on, 77-75. Scott will be meeting up with Kevin in the semi final, who took the first leg by just 4 points and held Soph to a 28-all draw in the second leg to take the tie 62-58.

Here is the current state of the bracket!
