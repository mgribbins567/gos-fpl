A couple close matches and a lot of blowouts this week, led by Jesse's narrow 32-31 victory over Coop! Elsewhere, Luke defeated Kevin 39-35 and MatthewR took this year's first Matthew derby 41-24. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 24-41 MatthewR

<br/>

This week sees maybe a first for the league(at least this many weeks into the season): a tie for first! Dylan and Darryan sit on 260 PF each, with Luke just 1 PF behind them! Further down the table the only movement from last week is MatthewR leapfrogging myself and Coop on PF at 9 points and Matt's win taking him ahead of Gavin to 10th.

And onto the game changers!

- MatthewR: Enzo Fernandez - Somehow this guy keeps scoring while putting in dire performances (if r/soccer is to be believed). His 3rd goal of the season and 5th goal contribution led MatthewR's team with 9 points.
- Matt: Omar Alderete - The Sunderland defender picked up an enormous 17 pointer against Ange's Nottingham Forest off the back of a goal, clean sheet, defensive contribution points, and of course 3 bonus as the mackems start their charge for Europe.
- Luke: Igor Thiago - Big week for Brentford's new striker as he finds the net for his 3rd and 4th times against Amorim's Manchester United. A solid 13 points with the 3 bonus to lead Luke's team to victory.
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalh√£es - Big Gabby headed home the stoppage time winner this week as Arsenal picks up Liverpool's plot armor they dropped in London? Anyway, a 13 pointer from the goal, 3 bonus, and 19 defensive contributions as Arsenal beat Newcastle 2-1.
- Jesse: Jeremy Doku - The speedy winger keeps his streak of good form going with a pair of assists against Burnley as Esteve knocks in 2 own goals :( 10 pointer for Doku
- Darryan: Erling Haaland - He's just a machine man. 2 goals and an assist against Burnley and then a pair of goals in the Champions League today. He's got 9 g/a in the prem after 6 games. 16 pointer for Darryan.

Congratulations to Luke on winning September manager of the month! He defeated Dylan by just 1 PF! October is another short month of just 3 gamweeks!

And we're finally at gameweek 6 so we can talk about the form table! Surprise, surprise, it is led by Luke, Dylan, and Darryan with 12/15 points earned!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 7 of The League(tm) group stage! Just 2 gameweeks left and still all to play for! Highlights from this week's slate of cross-league matches include a repeat scenario where the highest score in League A faced off against the highest score in League B, this time with Dylan defeating Morgs 54-51. Elsewhere, Alex picked up a close victory over Coop 35-31, Matt defeated Cara 42-37, Kevin took a narrow win over ZachA 35-30, Zach pulled out a win against Mack 32-27, and somehow my 24 pointer was enough to pick up a win against Emma, 24-19. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 24-19 Emma
- Luke 39-22 Divya
- MatthewR 41-32 John
- Gavin 32-40 Matthew2
- Darryan 52-35 Andrew
- Kevin 35-30 ZachA
- Dylan 54-51 Morgs
- Jesse 32-22 Travis
- Matt 42-37 Cara
- Coop 31-35 Alex
- Scott 22-34 Chris
- Zach 32-27 Mack

And as for the table, Jesse remains at the top with an undefeated 18 points! With a win this week he will confirm his spot in the top 8! However, he is followed closely by 5 managers sitting on 15 points: MatthewR, Dylan, Kevin, Chris, and Zach. Just behind those 6 are Darryan, Alex, and myself on 12 points, fighting for a spot in the top 8. Matthew2, Luke, and Matt are the teams with a 1 in the draw column on 10 points, and Andrew and John sit ahead of the group on 6 points in the middle of the top 8-16 zone(on 9 and 7 points, respectively).

Next week will have some great matchups, headlined by a top 7 match between Darryan and Chris! Other key matchups include a top 8 showdown between Kevin and Chris, and a top 10 match between Zach and Matthew2. We will also see MatthewR take on the September manager of the month for League B in Morgs, along with Coop and ZachA battling for a top 16 spot. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (9) vs Cara (22)
- Luke (11) vs Travis (20)
- MatthewR (2) vs Morgs (19)
- Gavin (21) vs Mack (16)
- Darryan (7) vs Chris (5)
- Kevin (4) vs Alex (8)
- Dylan (3) vs John (14)
- Jesse (1) vs Divya (23)
- Matt (12) vs Emma (24)
- Coop (17) vs ZachA (15)
- Scott (18) vs Andrew (13)
- Zach (6) vs Matthew2 (10)

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Kevin, Chris, Zach, ZachA, Coop
Fell off: Kevin, Chris

10 - Morgs (NEW) - League B - After all, this is a power ranking, so I think it's only fair to give the September manager of the month a spot on it. 3 wins in a row, averaging 43 per week across those and picking up the high score in a _very_ low scoring League B week.

9 - Dylan (NEW) - League A - Despite my distaste for a team that has Welbeck as the only serviceable FWD, his team seemingly continues to find a way to garner points, this time with a Gabriel 13 pointer. The injury to Livramento will hurt, though, considering his points from the start of the season are: 9, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6.

8 - Mack (-3) - League B - A rough week for Mack as she saw Tyrone Mings get injured, Elanga once again ride the bench for >60 minutes, and only get returns from Semenyo and Woltemade. Still think her team is good, but more points from Strand Larsen and Gyokeres are needed.

7 - Alex (+1) - League B - He's finding ways to win and keeps his spot atop the League B table, even with the off week. Bowen seems to be back to his usual ways and Odegaard is looking solid, so if he can find some more points from his defenders and 3rd/4th midfielders he'll only make his way up this list.

6 - Matthew (-3) - League A - A really rough week for my team and the (-3) might be an overreaction, considering the fact Mateta hit the inside of the post and Foden was robbed of a goal and assist by Steve... Still, my team has some question marks with its lack of defcon monsters.

5 - Jesse (+2) - League A - Am I appealing to him questioning my ranking every week? Maybe. Is he winning with 18 points on his bench and a red card on the field? Yep. It's hard to tell if the Sunderland keeper will keep up his insane form, but hey, it's working so far.

4 - MatthewR (+2) - League A - The golden defense moves up the list as none of them keep a clean sheet, yet 3/5 earned 3+ points this week. Nevermind Enzo somehow scoring his 3rd of the season and Watkins finally doing something.

3 - Luke (-1) - League A - Not much to say about this one as he's made solid moves to grab Senesi and Woltemade, who continue to bring in points. The only question mark is _when will Palmer return?_

2 - Darryan (+2) - League A - Haaland continues to wrack up points and Darryan puts up 52 with nothing more than a 2 pointer coming from his 5 player backline. Xhaka and Palhinha proved to be good pickups (at least this week), and triple Arsenal defense is always scary (if they all start).

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Hey, Rogers did something! Too bad I benched him for an Anderson 3 pointer. And Salah/Kudus/Rutter got me a total of 6 points, so a 40 point week to stay near the top of the overall PF table is solid.

Good luck all!
