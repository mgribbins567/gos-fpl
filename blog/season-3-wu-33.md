Happy gameweek 33! Waivers this week are due tomorrow at 5:30am PDT / 8:30am EDT because I _procrastinated_ (/had plans). This week saw the highest scoring week of the season, mostly thanks to Newcastle absolutely obliterating the two teams they faced! Highlights this week included Darryan pulling off the 42-33 upset over Zach, Matt sneaking a 33-31 win against Coop, Andrew picking up yet another win, this time against Emily 37-33, and Luke dropping a week-high 71 pointer against Scott's 26.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 27-44 Kevin
- MatthewR 60-31 Rebecca
- Dylan 21-40 Gavin
- Zach 33-42 Darryan
- Luke 71-26 Scott
- Matt 33-31 Coop
- Jesse 25-69 Soph
- Emily 33-37 Andrew

<br/>

This week sees very little movement across the table, with all in the top 4 winning, creating a 5 point gap between Luke in 4th and myself in 5th. I keep my 4 point lead over Zach, who is joined this week by Gavin. Nothing much changes until we reach the relegation spots, where Darryan and Soph's wins push them above Scott and just 2 and 3 points, respectively, from safety.

Now onto the Game Changers! Just the one single digit earner this week! Also, a **lot** of Newcastle.

- Kevin: Alexander Isak - Not even an incredible week for the striker considering his team scored 9 goals, but his goal and assist across the two games was enough for 11 points and a win for Kevin.
- MatthewR: Sandro Tonali - The Italian midfielder scored the first goal in Newcastle's 4-1 win against Manchester United this week to grab 2 bonus points, then assisted against Crystal Palace to bring his total to 15 points this week.
- Gavin: Bruno Guimaraes - The Brazilian midfielder also scored against Manchester United, but failed to assist against Crystal Palace, so he only got 10 points.
- Darryan: Mathys Tel - Woah! Not Newcastle! Anyway, Tel picked up his second goal this season against Wolves as Spurs faltered yet again 4-2. However, the Bayern Munich loanee grabbed 2 bonus points for 9 total on Darryan's behalf.
- Luke: Fabian Schar - Schar did _nothing_ against Manchester United, then grabbed a goal, clean sheet, and 2 bonus points as Newcastle defeated Crystal Palace 5-0. 16 points.
- Matt: Aaron Ramsdale - Funnily enough, Matt benefited enormously from Onana completely forgetting he's supposed to keep goals _out_ of the net against Lyon in the first leg (watch the highlights of the second if you haven't, though - insane game), as he found the bench and allowed Ramsdale to be subbed in. That gave Matt 16 points from 2 penalty saves, 7 total saves, and 3 bonus points as Southampton lost to Aston Villa 3-0. Also, the weirdest 2 pointer of all time came from Asensio as he missed 2 pens, kept a clean sheet, and got an assist.
- Soph: Harvey Barnes - Back to Newcastle! This week Soph picked up _46 points_ from 2 players. Barnes: 27; Jacob Murphy: 19. Barnes had 3 goals, 1 assist, 1 clean sheet point, and 4 total bonus points this double gameweek.
- Andrew: Joelinton - Yeah of course, 2 assists from the 2 games and a clean sheet point returned a solid 11 points for Andrew this week.

As for April manager of the month, Luke takes his PF lead as Gavin, Matt, and Kevin remain undefeated and in the race! Still 2 more weeks to go!

In terms of the form table, Luke has continued at the top with 15/15 points! Matt trails with 13/15 earned, and Gavin with 12/15.

Next week sees some great matchups, headlined by a top 6 matchup between Kevin and Zach! Elsewhere, Darryan takes on Jesse and Scott faces off against Emily in a couple of relegation 6 pointers, and Matt looks to fend off Gavin!

Full matchups are as follows:

- Soph (14) vs Matthew (5)
- Coop (10) vs Andrew (16)
- Scott (15) vs Emily (12)
- Darryan (13) vs Jesse (9)
- Gavin (7) vs Matt (2)
- Rebecca (8) vs Luke (4)
- Kevin (3) vs Zach (6)
- MatthewR (1) vs Dylan (11)

<br/>

- Some big matchups this week as all but me face a manager in the top 8
- I will need Kevin and Luke to drop points for any chance at 4th
- Kevin and Luke need 3 wins to secure top 5

<p class="center-bold">Relegation Table</p>

<br/>

- Darryan is in a great position to move out of the relegation zone this week, with Dylan playing MatthewR and his matchup against Jesse
- Jesse and Coop have the opportunity to put space between them and the drop zone these next couple of weeks with favorable matchups
- Dylan is in hell, but if he can get one win to close out the season he might have a shot at staying up

Shoutout this week to Luke for 6 wins in a row! Also shoutouts to Matt for 5 undefeated (4W1D), Gavin's 3 winstreak, and Soph for picking up back-to-back wins!
