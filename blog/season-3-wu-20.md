Happy gameweek 20! And congratulations everyone we have just hit the halfway point of our season - 19 gameweeks to go! Waivers have already come and gone this week and the free agency deadline is tomorrow at 3am PST / 6am EST! (Apologies for my lateness I was on a plane) This week saw a few upsets and a couple of close matchups, led by the draw in the Matthew derby 27-27! Elsewhere, Scott upset Jesse 29-27 and Matt fended off a nice week from Darryan 59-45.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 27-27 MatthewR
- Dylan 20-35 Kevin
- Zach 45-25 Rebecca
- Luke 53-31 Gavin
- Matt 59-45 Darryan
- Jesse 27-29 Scott
- Emily 37-25 Coop
- Andrew 20-53 Soph

This week sees MatthewR drop points for just the second time this season, as Matt closes the gap to 12. Luke's win takes him 2 points ahead of me, now 2 points above Jesse and 3 ahead of Kevin. Zach's win sits him in 7th, just 1 point behind Kevin and 2 above Dylan. Emily's win this week sees her enter the fray just a point behind Dylan and 3 ahead of the group on 24. Soph's win also moves her up the table 2 points above Darryan.

Now onto the Game Changers! (I'm not going to check) but I would harbor a guess that this week has the most defenders of any week this season with 4!

- MatthewR: Joao Pedro - Pedro carried Matthew's team this week with 1/3 of his total points off the back of assisting both Brighton goals in their 2-2 draw against Villa. The assists and bonus point put him at a total of 9 points this week. Also, shoutout Rico Lewis who was my highest scorer in this draw.
- Kevin: Morgan Gibbs-White - As Nottingham Forest keeps winning, MGW keeps bringing in points for Kevin, this week with 10 off the back of a goal, clean sheet, and 2 bonus points.
- Zach: Liam Delap - In a big win for Ipswich over Chelsea this week (2-0), Delap scored a dubious penalty and picked up an assist (+ 3 bonus points) to take home 11 points for Zach in his win.
- Luke: Morgan Rogers - Aston Villa's woes haven't quite impacted Morgan Rogers' fantasy output, as he picks up his second 1g+1a game in the past 3, this time for 2 bonus points and 11 total.
- Matt: Lewis Hall - Lewis Haul finds himself in the double digits for the second time this season (and has picked up 40 points the past 4 weeks). This time, he leads Matt's team with an assist, clean sheet, and 3 bonus points in Newcastle's 2-0 win against United.
- Scott: Ola Aina - For the second time this season, Aina has made this list off the back of a solid performance against Everton with 8 points from the clean sheet and 2 bonus.
- Emily: Rayan Ait-Nouri - While Wolves did concede twice, Ait-Nouri picked up 3 bonus points from his 2 assists against Spurs for a 10 pointer for Emily.
- Soph: Trent Alexander-Arnold - With rumors swirling about this man's future, he puts together quite the performance against West Ham off the back of a (deflected) goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus points for the (game changers) high of 15 points.

Congratulations once again to MatthewR for Manager of the Month! Due to picking up a draw instead of a loss, he has secured 1st in December by a single point. This is his 3rd MotM this season!

In terms of the form table, MatthewR remains at the top with 13/15 points earned! Just behind him sits Kevin, Matt, and Luke on 12/15 points earned over the past 5! Nothing has really changed since last week other than the draw!
