Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 15! Waivers this week were due this morning so free agency is open! Highlights this week include a crazy 54-52 win for Alex over Chris, and on the other side of the spectrum an 18-12 victory for Cara against ZachA and a 26-22 win for Divya against Travis. Full results are as follows:

- Morgs 37-52 Matthew
- Travis 22-26 Divya
- Emma 50-36 Andrew
- ZachA 12-18 Cara
- Chris 52-54 Alex
- John 36-56 Mack

<br/>

Heading over to the table we see a lot of movement in the top 8. Starting at the top, my lead grows to 11 points over John, who now sits just 1 point ahead of Alex. ZachA drops a spot and is joined by Cara on 22 points, 2 behind 3rd place. 1 point behind them sits Mack, Chris, and Morgan, who are closely followed (by 2 points) by Emma and Divya.

And now, onto the game changers!

- Matthew: Daniel Munoz - 14 pts - After two 14 pointers in 3 weeks the Crystal Palace defender moves up to _second_ in total points this season. What a guy.
- Divya: Maxence Lacroix - 8 pts - Not quite a goal scored, but Lacroix picked up his 7th clean sheet and 8th defcon of the season against Burnley.
- Emma: Phil Foden - 17 pts - Phil Foden has now scored more goals in his last 2 games than he has children.
- Cara: Anthony Gordon - 6 pts - Showed up for 24 minutes, scored a dubious penalty, got Cara the win. Solid week.
- Alex: Jan Paul van Hecke - 12 pts - You may be thinking: "that's an odd score for a defender," well you'd be right because that's what you get when you score 2 goals, concede 4, and get 0 bonus points.
- Mack: Marc Guehi - 14 pts - He's like Munoz if instead of goals he got defcon every time.

After the first week of December Mack takes the lead on PF! Alex, myself, and Emma all also sit at 50+!

In terms of form, I sit at the top of the table with 15/15 points earned! Divya is the sole manager with 4 wins in her last 5!

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 2 matchup between me and John! Elsewhere, we'll see some fascinating matchups including one between Mack and Chris, a top 4 match between Alex and ZachA, and a matchup that could see Divya moving up the board as she takes on Morgs. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (1) vs John (2)
- Mack (6) vs Chris (7)
- Alex (3) vs ZachA (4)
- Cara (5) vs Emma (9)
- Andrew (11) vs Travis (12)
- Divya (10) vs Morgs (8)

Shoutout this week to myself for 5 in a row! And also to Emma for 4 undefeated (3W1D), Cara for 3 in a row, and to Alex and Divya for notching back to back wins!

# Boxing Day Bash

Hello everyone and welcome to week 4 of the Boxing Day Bash! This week saw some interesting matches, headlined by our first draw: a 36-all matchup between John and Andrew in Group A! Over in Group B, Mack and Emma each put up big wins to go joint top on 9 points. Full results are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew 52-26 Divya
- John 36-36 Andrew
- Alex 54-22 Travis

These results see me take top spot in the group on 9 points, followed by Alex who is in a great spot to make the playoffs on 6 points!

Group B

- ZachA 12-56 Mack
- Chris 52-37 Morgs
- Cara 18-50 Emma

As mentioned earlier, Mack and Emma take control over the group with 9 points each (and with a potential week 5 1-seed deciding matchup in hand). Morgs, Chris, and Cara are all battling it out on 3 points (and ZachA isn't quite out of it yet)

That means there are some big matchups next week, including the ability for me to clinch the 1 seed from Group A with a win against Alex! Over in Group B, we'll see Chris and Cara battle it out around the elimination spots, along with a matchup between Mack and Morgs! Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew vs Alex
- John vs Travis
- Andrew vs Divya

Group B

- ZachA vs Emma
- Chris vs Cara
- Morgs vs Mack

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): John, ZachA, Kevin, Matt
Fell off: John, ZachA

10 - Scott (-1) - League A - The curse of making the Power Rankings list hit Scott hard as he saw 8 points sit on his bench and a whole lot of 1s and 0s on the field. Even still, Neto has looked _very_ solid in recent weeks along with Bruno Fernandes. Who knows, could just be rotation due to the midweek games.

9 - Emma (NEW) - League B - Emma has been slowly moving onto my radar during her run of mid-30s and 40s gameweeks but back to back 50 point weeks has earned her a spot on this list. Granted, 4 goals from Foden between the two weeks definitely helped, but if Wirtz can get some points and White continues deputizing at RB her team is looking solid.

8 - MatthewR (NEW) - League A - Okay fine I'll put MatthewR (back) on the list. And it's not purely because Watkins got his first double digit return of the season. Okay maybe it is mostly that. Anyway, Odegaard is back, Tarkowski and Lacroix are defcon beasts, and Schade will soon be basically the only winger Brentford has once Dango goes to afcon.

7 - Mack (-) - League B - A solid week (read: highest score in League B) from Mack including 8 points from each of her new additions in Casemiro and Wieffer, along with defcon beast Semenyo leading the charge ahead of a Guehi 14 pointer. Plus, Gyokeres is back.

6 - Matthew (-) - League A - A solid week (read: highest score in League A) from myself. Shoutout Foden and curses to whatever youth coach made Merino a midfielder because this guy is a beast going forward. Also, Munoz is the best defender in the game. If only I could get some players who play every game though...

5 - Darryan (-) - League A - A return to form that was just enough to keep me at bay, yet not enough to push further forward. Haaland is back to his goalscoring ways - wait, he got 2 assists? Welcome back Kevin de Bruyne. Also, Onana popped up with a goal, Arsenal kept a clean sheet (despite Timber being benched) and so did Nottingham Forest, because they played Wolves.

4 - Luke (-2) - League A - A bit of a rough week for Luke as he got the win but really only had the Nottingham Forest clean and Crystal Palace clean sheets (+ the Woltemessi assist) to show for it. I'm sure he'll be back but the midweek rotation scheme a few teams pulled really hurt his team.

3 - Dylan (-) - League A - Apparently Van Hecke is a striker now and Salah rides the bench? Anyway, definitely not a bad week from Dylan but the Mosquera injury definitely hurts, plus he's about to have to come to terms with losing his star player to afcon, Dango Ouattara. Oh and also Mo Salah is going to be gone too.

2 - Zach (+2) - League A - And up he goes again off the back of a Guehi 14 pointer and the second best goalkeeper in the league (Henderson). Rogers, Wieffer, and Saka all put in solid shifts as well, and Kroupi Jr got a start. Didn't do anything with it, but still.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Yet another good week from this team thanks to the Munoz and Richards returns alongside Hincapie clean sheet, Kudus finding an assist to Spurs striker Romero, and Rogers getting an assist to OLLIE. Anderson didn't get defcon though, so that was a bit disappointing.

Good luck all!
