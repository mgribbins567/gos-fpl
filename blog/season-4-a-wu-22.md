Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 22! This break was brought to you by the FA and Carabao cups so waivers are due Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST! Also, you may notice that some of the images in the update look different! That's because I finally decided to write a script to make me pngs of my Google Sheets cell ranges instead of doing it manually (in order to _hopefully_ save me time in the future). Some look a little weird and I'm still taking ~4 screenshots manually but it's a start. Some wild matches this week, headlined by the back and forth matchup between me and Kevin in which I pulled through with a 40-39 win! Elsewhere, Scott upset Zach 47-40, Coop upset MatthewR 41-30, and Jesse picked up a big win against Dylan 32-29. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 40-39 Kevin
- Zach 40-47 Scott
- Coop 41-30 MatthewR
- Gavin 25-39 Matt
- Darryan 58-39 Luke
- Jesse 32-29 Dylan

<br/>

Taking a look at the table, Darryan's win this week takes him a whole 4 points above Zach and MatthewR at the top! The latter duo sits just 3 points ahead of Jesse, who has passed Dylan on PF. I lead the group 3 points behind them, joined by Kevin and Luke. Scott and Coop both pick up wins, closing the gap to 6 points and keeping their 2 point lead over Matt.

Game Changers!

- Matthew: Harvey Barnes - 15 pts - Genuinely a huge pickup by me this week as the Englishman (or potentially Scottishman soon?) scored 2 goals in an insane 4-3 game between Newcastle and Leeds this week to lead my team to a 1 point win.
- Scott: Alisson Becker - 10 pts - In just a very boring game between Arsenal and Liverpool that ended with 0 goals from each side, Scott profited from the clean sheet, 4 saves from the Brazilian, and all 3 bonus points.
- Coop: Nathan Collins - 13 pts - A massive defcon adjustment pulled Collins up to 13 points this week, extending his streak of getting 4+ points to 6 weeks and including 4 8+ point returns. This clean sheet was bolstered by an assist and 10 defcon.
- Matt: Bruno Guimaraes - 11 pts - 3 double digit returns in a row and his 7th of the season as the Brazilian somehow continues to be a really solid FPL asset. Surprisingly.
- Darryan: Brenden Aaronson - 14 pts - What a pickup this guy was for Darryan. 3 goals in the last 2 coming off a brace against Newcastle, plus he gets defcon (got unlucky to be adjusted down to 11 this week). USA USA USA
- Jesse: Jeremy Doku - 8 pts - Didn't watch this one but the Brighton magic continues against Manchester City as the cityzens rescue a 1-1 draw against their arch nemeses. And somehow Doku got an assist and all 3 bonus.

2/5 gameweeks down and Coop is the only manager to have won both weeks! He keeps his lead over Darryan and Matt who are on 4 points.

In terms of form, I now take the top spot with 12/15 points earned just ahead of Coop on PF! Did not expect to see that tbh.

This week will see some great matchups, headlined by a huge top 3 matchup where MatthewR hopes to slow down Darryan! Elsewhere, Zach goes against my team in what should be a fun one, Coop looks to continue his good form with a match against Kevin, and Dylan takes on Luke! Full matchups are as follows:

- Zach (2) vs Matthew (6)
- Coop (10) vs Kevin (7)
- Gavin (12) vs Scott (9)
- Darryan (1) vs MatthewR (3)
- Jesse (4) vs Matt (11)
- Dylan (5) vs Luke (8)

Shoutouts this week to Coop for 4 wins in a row! Also to Darryan and Matt for going 2 unbeaten (1W1D)!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 3 of the knockout rounds of The League (tm) and our first quarter final round! We have finally exited the playoffs and every matchup from here on out will be two-legged! But first, the results from this week were headlined by a crazy matchup between Luke and Andrew in which the latter took the win 41-39 to extend his playoff run having now defeated both Allens! Elsewhere, the play-in managers continue their streaks as Alex defeated Kevin 44-39 and my League B team beat Chris 60-36. Darryan is the only 5th-8th place finisher to win, beating MatthewR 58-30. Full results of this round are as follows:

- Darryan 58-30 MatthewR
- Chris 36-60 Matthew2
- Luke 39-41 Andrew
- Kevin 39-44 Alex

This will set up some great quarter final matchups for the next couple of weeks, headlined by a Matthew Gribbins derby between my League A and League B teams (-,-)! Full matchups are as follows:

- Jesse vs Darryan
- Matthew vs Matthew2
- Zach vs Andrew
- Dylan vs Alex

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Jesse, Matt, Luke, Emma, Andrew, Coop
Fell off: Emma

10 - Alex (NEW) - League B - Last 5: 32 (L), 38 (L), 61 (W), 58 (W), 44 (W) - `Meanwhile I'm over here glad that Matthew overlooked my 61 then 58 the two weeks before last update cause every time I'm in the rankings proper I throw up a stinker` -Alex, January 11th, 2026 at 4:13pm PST. Hate to do this to you but Morgs could use a win. Anyway, Tavernier seems to be destined to be the main man for Bournemouth with Semenyo off to City and Kluivert injured, which also provides Kroupi the opportunity to get some starts under his belt. Plus, Alex has surprisingly good FPL asset Bruno Guimaraes who _surely_ won't return double digits for the 4th week in a row, right?

9 - John (+1) - League B - Last 5: 43 (W), 31 (W), 46 (W), 31 (W), 42 (W) - Another win and another week sticking on the list for John as he continues riding the DCL train to victory as he scored and assisted to bring his g/a on the season to 11. On top of that, Gabriel is back with another return, Bruno Fernandes has risen from the dead to find they actually fired Amorim (and that he should start playing further forward), and Raul Jimenez spearheads a Europe-challenging Fulham team (idk if I expected this one...). That said, Paqueta may be shipping off to Brazil soon and Emi can't stop getting injured, so there are potentially some holes to fill.

8 - Chris (-1) - League B - Last 5: 47 (D), 60 (W), 42 (W), 63 (W), 36 (W) - A bit of a stumble for Chris this week as Saliba and the Welsh Messi were the only 2 players to pick up 5+ points, but not to worry as defcon beasts Tarkowski and Caicedo continue to put up their usual numbers (the number is 4). On top of that, Rice and Xhaka have high floors and Watkins just took a quick week off. That said, who knows what Reijnders' minutes will look like going forward, Wilson has already been banished by West Ham, and does anyone know if Barry is good? Please help.

7 - Mack (+1) - League B - Last 5: 52 (L), 46 (W), 51 (W), 41 (W), 53 (W) - That's now a 49 point per week average over the last 5 for Mack as she puts up another 50-pointer off the back of impressive performances across the board. Led by Nathan Collins the goat with his back to back double digit haul, 3 MIDs with defcon and Semenyo with his goal, a Guehi clean sheet and Woltemade assist, plus Strand Larsen sat the bench and morally supported the team with his own assist. The only question mark here is _what will Semenyo at City look like?_ And as of writing this, he's started 2 games and scored in both of them so that seems pretty good? On top of that G+ayokeres scored and assisted against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup so he is BACK.

6 - Kevin (-) - League A - Last 5: 45 (W), 56 (W), 27 (L), 45 (W), 39 (L) - Really a rough week for Kevin: Thiaw giving away 2 goals to Leeds in the first half and getting subbed at halftime on -1 point, Keane scoring against Wolves but then deciding to yank some hair to get sent off, Gravenberch hitting 8 defensive contributions in the first half against Arsenal just to end the game with _9_, all to lose by 1 point to me. Anyway despite Keane being suspended, MGW has 2 goals in 2, DCL is still on fire, and as mentioned 1 manager ago, Gyokeres is BACK.

5 - MatthewR (-1) - League A - Last 5: 39 (L), 77 (W), 50 (W), 51 (W), 30 (L) - MatthewR called this his "quad-weekly stinker" which is 50% true: yes it was a stinker, but it has been _5_ weeks since the 23 pointer. A 30 isn't that bad (the manager breakdown board doesn't discriminate between 30 and 39), but also Gordon and Enzo 1 pointers (including a 64 minute cameo for the latter - I thought he was nailed for 90 every week?), Kolo Muani looks to be a still unknown quantity and Solanke is BACK, and Dango returns soon which could hurt Schade's minutes. Although I doubt it. However, I have faith in Tarky/Lacroix/Odegaard/Watkins and :kai: has returned from injury.

4 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Last 5: 51 (W), 39 (W), 41 (W), 30 (L), 40 (W) - While my accursed streak of dropping players and seeing them score well continues (cough Mitoma cough), I did drop him for a player who scored _two_ goals. Maybe I'm cashing in on my past blunders? Maybe the FPL gods are looking down at my team and saying 'yeah let's give him a single digit win for once.' Either way my guys seem pretty solid if they can just score the damn ball (and not get only 1 defcon when at 10 at halftime). Semenyo has looked solid in a City shirt so far, Gakpo is doing something sometimes, and Tielemans somehow had 0.49 xGI against Crystal Palace... how tf did these guys not score. Anyway maybe Mateta will have used this nice break to lock in for the next 17 weeks.

3 - Zach (-1) - League A - Last 5: 50 (W), 37 (L), 46 (W), 28 (L), 40(L) - Unlucky loss for Zach this week so maybe Darryan _did_ invest in that Etsy witch. That said the interim manager did what Amorim could not and told the United players to pass the ball to Sesko and what would you know, he scored 2 (don't listen to how he told them to defend though). On top of the tall Slovenian lad Tavernier has looked solid this season and will only see more of the ball with Semenyo gone (_someone has to shoot 10+ times a game_), Casemiro has been a defcon beast, and Ekitike is already back. Huge get for Slot truthers.

2 - Matthew2 (+1) - League B - Last 5:55 (W), 34 (L), 22 (L), 61 (W), 60 (W) - Back to back 60+ weeks after trusting my gut and picking up Janelt (11 and 7 pointers) and Mane (9 pointer) on top of solid performances from the whole squad tbh. Thiago has been enormous, Anderson, Senesi, Dorgu, and Janelt all bringing home assists, and Evanilson finally realizing he is a striker. Plus Munoz should be back shortly and Salah returns from afcon shortly with a 3rd or 4th place in hand thanks to Senegal.

1 - Darryan (-) - League A - Last 5: 68 (W), 40 (W), 42 (L), 43 (D), 58 (W) - Another huge week for Darryan not only in picking up the win but also in closing the PF gap with Zach as he somehow predicted a Brenden Aaronson 14 pointer to lead his useless Manchester City MID duo. Statistically, this means that Aaronson is worth 7x Cherki + Rodri, just sayin. On top of that, Raul, Evanilson, and Haaland continue their solid form as Darryan's FWD trio and Kelleher was gifted a penalty save. Oh and of course he left a Saliba 7 pointer on the bench.

Good luck all!
