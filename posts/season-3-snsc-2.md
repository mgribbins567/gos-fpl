Happy gameweek 2 of the Short n' Sweet cup! That's gameweek 1/3 spoken for, so let's jump right in! Highlights from this group stage round include the Group C upsets of Soph defeating Dylan 28-23 and Kevin scoring big against Luke, 62-41. In Group D, we saw the narrowest match of the week in which Jesse took a 33-30 win against Coop and an upset, where Darryan's 31 points was enough to beat my 23 pointer. The full results are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR 43-17 Andrew
- Zach 29-51 Gavin

**Group B**

- Matt 44-17 Scott
- Rebecca 55-7 Emily

**Group C**

- Dylan 23-28 Soph
- Luke 41-62 Kevin

**Group D**

- Matthew 23-31 Darryan
- Jesse 33-30 Coop

As this cup is Short n' Sweet after all, next week will see managers confirm their places in the knockouts! I haven't done the math, but I do believe that 6 points does mathematically guarantee top 3. Some interesting matchups to look out for include MatthewR vs Zach in Group A, Dylan vs Kevin in Group C which may turn out to be a must-win for Dylan following Soph's upset, and Group D sees the winners (and losers) face off from last week with me vs Coop and Jesse vs Darryan, which should result in an interesting looking table heading into the final gameweek. Full matchups are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR vs Zach
- Gavin vs Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt vs Emily
- Rebecca vs Scott

**Group C**

- Dylan vs Kevin
- Luke vs Soph

**Group D**

- Matthew vs Coop
- Jesse vs Darryan
