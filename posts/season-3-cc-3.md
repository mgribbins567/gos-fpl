Hello everybody and welcome to gameweek 3 of the Champions Cup! This week saw a ton of close matchups, starting in Group A, where Rebecca took a narrow 49-46 win over MatthewR. Group B and D saw the same result in 2 different matchups, with Matt and Luke winning 32-29 over Coop and Darryan, respectively. And finally, a draw in Group D between me and Dylan at 37!

Full results are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR 46-49 Rebecca
- Jesse 14-42 Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt 32-29 Coop
- Gavin 34-55 Scott

**Group C**

- Kevin 39-18 Emily
- Zach 70-29 Soph

**Group D**

- Luke 32-29 Darryan
- Matthew 37-37 Dylan

So, with one week left in **Group Stage 1** let's take a look at each group! And to save time, most of the 'can clinches' work with a draw but I didn't really feel like writing all that out considering our 1 scheduled draw has already occurred.

**Group A**

- 1 - 6 pts - Rebecca: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Andrew.
- 2 - 3 pts - MatthewR: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Jesse, Rebecca loss, and +16 point difference vs Rebecca.
- 3 - 3 pts - Andrew: Can clinch 2nd with a win vs Rebecca and MatthewR loss. Unlikely to fall to 4th (40 PD) or reach 1st (42 PD).
- 4 - 0 pts - Jesse: Unlikely to reach 3rd (40 PD).

Gameweek 3 matchups:

- MatthewR vs Jesse
- Rebecca vs Andrew

**Group B**

- 1 - 6 pts - Matt: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Gavin.
- 2 - 3 pts - Scott: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Coop, Matt loss, and +11 point difference vs Matt.
- 3 - 3 pts - Gavin: Can clinch 2nd with a win vs Matt and Scott loss. Unlikely to go to 2nd on PF (25 PD) or 1st (35 PD).
- 4 - 0 pts - Coop: Can clinch 3rd with win vs Scott, Gavin loss, and +8 point difference vs Gavin. Unlikely to go 2nd (32 PD).

Gameweek 3 matchups:

- Matt vs Gavin
- Coop vs Scott

**Group C**

- 1 - 6 pts - Kevin: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Zach.
- 2 - 3 pts - Zach: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Kevin.
- 3 - 3 pts - Emily: Can clinch 2nd with a win vs Soph and Zach loss. Unlikely to go 2nd or 1st on PF. (Too many super unlikely scenarios with the weird PF in this group but she's at the bottom)
- 4 - 0 pts - Soph: Can clinch 3rd with a win vs Emily. Unlikely to go 2nd on PF (49 PD).

Gameweek 3 matchups:

- Kevin vs Zach
- Emily vs Soph

**Group D**

- 1 - 4 pts - Dylan: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Darryan.
- 2 - 3 pts - Darryan: Can clinch 1st with a win vs Dylan and if Luke wins, at most -15 point difference vs Luke.
- 3 - 3 pts - Luke: Can clinch 1st with a win vs me and Dylan vs Darryan draw OR Dylan loss and +16 point difference vs Darryan.
- 4 - 1 pts - Matthew: Can clinch 2nd with a win vs Luke and either: Dylan win OR Darryan win and at most -4 point difference vs Dylan.

Gameweek 3 matchups:

- Luke vs Matthew
- Darryan vs Dylan

I think that's just about it! Looking at the fixtures for next week, that means the most interesting matchups would be Matt vs Gavin from Group B, Kevin vs Zach of course from Group C, and honestly both matchups from Group D due to that pesky draw.

And here's some pictures, including what **Group Stage 2** would look like if _nothing changes_! (seems likely)
