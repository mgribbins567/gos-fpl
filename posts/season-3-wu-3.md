Happy gameweek 3! Waivers this week are due on Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This week was a week of blowouts with 5/8 matchups being decided by 15+ points. Huge wins for MatthewR and Dylan, who dropped 60 points each against Rebecca (36 points) and Gavin (28 points), Scott, who put up 58 points en route to a 58-34 win over Luke, and Kevin, who bounced back from last week's loss with a 52-36 victory over me. The closest match of the week saw Emily pick up her 1st win of the season in a 22-20 barnburner against Andrew (and that's with Wolves losing 6-2!).

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 36-52 Kevin
- MatthewR 60-36 Rebecca
- Dylan 60-28 Gavin
- Zach 27-34 Darryan
- Luke 34-58 Scott
- Matt 45-24 Coop
- Jesse 27-18 Soph
- Emily 22-20 Andrew

This week sees just 3 teams remain undefeated! MatthewR rides the momentum of his 60 pointer up to 1st, Matt remains in 2nd, and Jesse triumphs in another low scoring matchup to round out the managers on 6 points. Just behind this group, the host of managers with 50% win rate is led by Scott, who has the most Points For at 105. Myself, Gavin, and Coop sit winless after 2.

Onto... the Game Changers (name pending)! This week had some just insane point talleys for single players, so let's get started!

- Kevin: Kevin de Bruyne - Solid performance in the 4-1 win for City over Ipswich and 12 points from a goal (gifted to him), an excellent assist, and 2 bonus points. Turns out to be a great backup for 1st round Solanke so far.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - Everything he touches turns to gold (except against City). A great finish to chip Sa and 3 assists to Madueke (and 2 bonus) put his tally at 17 points, leading MatthewR to the top of the table.
- Dylan: Cristian Romero - Spurs scored off a corner? Romero put up 14 points off the back of aforementioned goal, a clean sheet, and 2 bonus points. Similar to MatthewR, a London rival led Dylan's team to victory this week.
- Darryan: Van de Ven - Another Spurs player, Van de Ven proved to be the difference maker in Darryan's close matchup this week, providing 9 points from an assist and clean sheet.
- Scott: Son - I suppose this is the consequence of a 4-0 win, huh. Son lead Scott's wild 58 point week with 2 goals, 3 bonus, and a clean sheet point to boot. Pickford was a Scott believer this week.
- Matt: Haaland - The first of the hat tricks this week (the other being un-owned), Haaland contributed 38% of Matt's points with 17. 3 goals, 3 bonus, 3 points for Matt.
- Jesse: Gordon - And somehow, Jesse puts up another week in the 20s and wins. This time, he was lead by Gordon who tapped in a goal and 3 bonus points for Jesse's team. A solid performance from his player and a good win.
- Emily: Strand Larsen - In what turned out to somehow be a non-disastrous week for Emily following Wolves' 6-2 loss to Chelsea in which each of her defenders saw -2 or more on their breakdown, Strand Larsen booted home a goal and took her to 3 points against Andrew.

In terms of August Manager of the Month, we just have 1 gameweek left! That means all of us 3 at the bottom of the table are eliminated from contention for the prize. Since the table is the same as the league table, that means MatthewR, Matt, and Jesse are the forerunners.

Form table still on pause :)

Next week should see some great matchups! Hopefully closer than the matches this week. Starting off with our marquee matchup: MatthewR vs Dylan! These two managers each put up 60 points this week, so if past seasons are anything to go by, this will be something like 25-22. Other matches to keep an eye on include Coop vs Andrew, two teams searching for a bit of consistency, Darryan vs Jesse, as Jesse competes for a shot at Manager of the Month, and Rebecca vs Luke, a matchup that will see two teams with very similar points for totals face off for their second wins of the season. Full matchups are:

- Soph (12) vs Matthew (14)
- Coop (16) vs Andrew (8)
- Scott (4) vs Emily (12)
- Darryan (9) vs Jesse (3)
- Gavin (15) vs Matt (2)
- Rebecca (9) vs Luke (7)
- Kevin (5) vs Zach (11)
- MatthewR (1) vs Dylan (5)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR and Dylan for the first 60+ weeks of the season! And to MatthewR (again), Matt, and Jesse for their back-to-back wins! And lastly, Scott, for heading into the 3rd gameweek 1st in Points For with 105! The only manager averaging 50+ over these two weeks.
