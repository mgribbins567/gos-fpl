Hello everybody! I won't lie to the girls and guys of this group when saying I meant to send this out way earlier, but without further ado... 

I hope you enjoyed the taste of a secondary competition during the kickoff cup, because it may just be a coincidence that another tournament is starting next week! There are slim pickins on the waiver list so you're going to want to be the sharpest tool when making transfers these next few weeks (or hope your current team beds in some chem), because unlike the kickoff cup, last place in groups is *not* in my good graces. On the other hand, finishing first in your group guarantees your quarterfinal appearance, so I'm hoping to see a lot of managers saying please please please over the course of gameweek 3. That's right - a bye for 1st! In fact, we *haven't* ever tried this one. Don't smile too much though if you finish your group in 1st, because every knockout round matchup will be single elimination. And, since I have a tendency to be dumb & poetic and unable to properly schedule things, this tournament will last (longer than) the entirety of December with the final taking place during Gameweek 20 - the first gameweek of January! I think that's everything, so buckle up, grab a cup of espresso, and welcome to the Short n' Sweet cup!

# Seeding

For those who are new, mid-season cups are seeded based on the league rankings at the time of tournament start. That means, the following groups will be generated:

Group A
- 1st
- 8th
- 9th
- 16th

Group B
- 2nd
- 7th
- 10th
- 15th

Group C
- 3rd
- 6th
- 11th
- 14th

Group D
- 4th
- 5th
- 12th
- 13th

Currently, with 1 week to go before the groups are set, that looks like this!

Once this gameweek has concluded, the group stage will be filled and the matchups will be generated!

# Group Stage

If you couldn't interpret my intro, there will be 4 groups with 4 teams each. Each team will play one another once, with the 4th place team being eliminated and the group winner receiving a bye in the next round. Tie breakers and everything will be done as usual! The group stage will take place from Gameweek 14-16.

# Knockout Stage

All knockout stage matches are single elimination, including the final. The first round will consist of opposing group 2 and 3 seeds facing off, with the winners going up against another group's 1 seed in the quarter finals. The knockout stage will take place from Gameweek 17-20.

# Prizing

And lastly, the prize is still $30 + a mystery kit!

Good luck and welcome to the Short n' Sweet cup!
