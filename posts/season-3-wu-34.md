This week sees some islands being formed, and some movement around our relegation places! Starting at the top, MatthewR's lead drops to just 9 points (:eyes:)... could he? no...? unless...? Anyway, all the way down to 5th remains the same, where my little island forms as a 7 point gap sits between me and Zach/Gavin. Our movement further down sees Darryan escape the relegation spots, jumping all the way to 11th with his 2nd win in 2 weeks, over Dylan and Emily. Scott also gains ground with his win, pushing him up to 14th over Soph. Also, Andrew hits 21 points!

Now onto the Game Changers! I'm not going to fact check but I think this may be the first time we've had players all in double digits?

- Matthew: Ryan Sessegnon - My blunder of putting this man on my bench was rectified when 2 of my players decided to vanish this week, so his assist and (banked) clean sheet points saved my week! He grabbed 2 bonus as well to take his total to 11 points, while Fulham lost 1-2 to Chelsea.
- Andrew: Yoane Wissa - Another big week for Wissa and Andrew as the Brentford striker picked up a goal, assist, and 2 bonus (11 total) en route to a 4-2 win against Brighton.
- Scott: Leandro Trossard - Anne Hathaway's cheering as Trossard drops a 24 pointer this week off the back of 3 goals, a clean sheet point, and 4 total bonus points.
- Darryan: Nico O'Reilly - Despite playing out of position the wrong direction, the youngster picked up 11 points in City's 2-0 win against Everton - scoring a goal and picking up 3 bonus - and topped it off with 2 more points against Villa to lead Darryan's team.
- Matt: Bryan Mbeumo - The talisman for Brentford showed up alongside Wissa this week, notching 2 more goals, an assist, and 3 bonus points for a total return of 18 in only 1 game. That's 18 goals and 7 assists on the season!
- Luke: Jakub Kiwior - The Pole is silencing the doubters as he's put up 4 solid performances in a row now, with 2 of them coming this gameweek off the back of a clean sheet against Ipswich and goal against Crystal Palace, for a 13 pointer.
- Kevin: Pedro Neto - Neto's fantastic strike in the dying minutes against Fulham was enough to secure him 3 bonus points and the win for Chelsea. It also resulted in 10 points for Kevin as he picks up another 3 points in a difficult matchup.
- Dylan: Dean Henderson - Solid week for the Crystal Palace keeper as his clean sheet points, 4 saves, and 2 bonus against Bournemouth was increased slightly with his 1 pointer against Arsenal. Still, he pulled in a vital 10 points for Dylan. Also shoutout Mitchell for the 7 pointer for MatthewR in this draw.

As for April manager of the month we have just one week left! We still have 3 teams undefeated: Luke, Matt, and Kevin! The first of the bunch has a mighty PF lead, so Matt and Kevin will need a win and Luke loss to have a chance at the award!

In terms of the form table, Luke is still at the top with 15/15 points! Matt trails in second with 13/15 earned, and me and Kevin with 12/15.

Next week sees some great matchups, headlined by the classic Matthew derby between me and MatthewR! Elsewhere, we'll see important matchups in the top-4 and relegation races in Luke vs Gavin, Jesse vsScott, and Emily vs Coop!

- Matthew (5) vs MatthewR (1)
- Dylan 12() vs Kevin (3)
- Zach (6) vs Rebecca (8)
- Luke (4) vs Gavin (7)
- Matt (2) vs Darryan (11)

# The Run In

Colors!

### The Race for Top 4

<p class="center-bold">Top 4 Table</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/34/top-4-table.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br/>

- Big challenge for me vs MatthewR (if I win I may need to add another column to this table...)
- Luke vs Gavin and Zach vs Rebecca could also be consequential matchups
- These guys in 2nd-4th won't lose......

<br />
<p class="center-bold">Relegation Table</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/34/relegation-table.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br/>

- Dylan's draw could be substantial here since it puts him in position to stay ahead of Soph if she wins
- Darryan looks to be in a much more comfortable position, being the only manager with 6/6 points on this table
  - Has a difficult matchup this week, but then has his own fate in his hands with matchups against 3 managers on this table + Andrew
- Jesse and Coop could find themselves in uncomfortable spots if Scott and Emily win against them this week
- Soph's best chance at safety is picking up the easier wins in the next 2 to hit 40 points

Shoutout this week to Luke for 7 wins in a row! Also shoutouts to Matt for 6 undefeated (5W1D), Kevin for his 4 winstreak, Andrew and Darryan for back to back wins, and MatthewR for 2 undefeated (1W1D).
