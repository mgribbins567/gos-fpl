Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 4 and the first international break of the season! Waivers this week are due on Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This is also the first week with full waivers, meaning everyone is available! Also, a quick plug for [gosfpl.com/player-search](https://www.gosfpl.com/player-search) which I've put together to filter and search players (and is a work in progress, especially on mobile). That said, let's begin with the headliner of this week's results: Alex's 24-21 win against Chris! Elsewhere, Andrew picked up him first win (taking him to 0 point difference) in a 26-22 showdown with Emma, John put his first points on the board in a 50-35 win against Mack, and ZachA continues his winning ways with a 71-23 win against Cara. Full results are as follows:

- Morgs 28-42 Matthew
- Travis 37-22 Divya
- Emma 22-26 Andrew
- ZachA 71-23 Cara
- Chris 21-24 Alex
- John 50-35 Mack

<br/>

This week sees Zach take the undisputed top spot as the only undefeated team! Mine and Alex's wins take us 2nd and 3rd, just ahead of Chris and Cara on PF. The rest of the table sits on 3 points as we've now seen every team pick up a win!

Now onto the game changers! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to watch too much this weekend, so I'll do my best.

- Matthew: Daniel Munoz - 9 pts - Mr. Consistency for me this season continues his streak of getting 5+ points with a clean sheet against Aston Villa, somehow.
- Travis: Virgil van Dijk - 8 pts - Clean sheet against Arsenal :(
- Andrew: Erling Haaland - 9 pts - Soon to be the only non-injured player on Andrew's team. Oh wait he just got hit by a bus door and got 3 stitches.
- ZachA: Trevoh Chalobah - 13 pts - How do these Chelsea defenders keep getting goal contributions? This guy has as many goal contributions as Chris Wood.
- Alex: Jarrod Bowen - 9 pts - West Ham showed a sign of life? Or just Bowen realizing he's their only player again.
- John: Dominik Szoboszlai - 13 pts - The out of position midfielder playing defense gambit worked I guess.

Congratulations to ZachA for winning August manager of the month! He won outright, being the only undefeated team across the month! The board resets now that it is September, so good luck all!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 3 matchup between Alex and ZachA. Elsewhere, Mack and Chris face off in a battle of 'goes by a shortened form of their name', Andrew looks to pick up some steam against a fellow team on 3 points in Travis, and Divya and Morgs square off to make some space with the bottom of the table. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs John
- Mack vs Chris
- Alex vs ZachA
- Cara vs Emma
- Andrew vs Travis
- Divya vs Morgs

And finally, some shoutouts! First of which goes to ZachA for his 3 winstreak! And also one to Alex for picking up back-to-back wins!

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 4 of The League(tm) group stage! This week saw a number of great matchups, with the most interesting probably being the 42-all draw between Luke and my team in the B league. Elsewhere, John took an impressive victory over Gavin 50-40 and Zach narrowly defeated Travis 40-37. Also, this week was heavily weighted toward League A, with the left side only losing 2 and drawing 1 (out of 12 matches). Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 38-71 ZachA
- Luke 42-42 Matthew2
- MatthewR 52-26 Andrew
- Gavin 40-50 John
- Darryan 32-22 Emma
- Kevin 34-22 Divya
- Dylan 48-35 Mack
- Jesse 52-24 Alex
- Matt 27-21 Chris
- Coop 30-23 Cara
- Scott 36-28 Morgs
- Zach 40-37 Travis

As for the table, only 2 undefeated teams left in MatthewR and Jesse! Following them is a whole host of teams on 6 points! Still plenty of games left to play in this group stage though so anything can happen!

Next week should have some fun ones though, headlined by our first Zach derby! Elsewhere, Gavin faces off against Chris in what could be an entertaining matchup, Coop looks to take on Andrew, and Alex hopes to replicate his result this week against Darryan. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Travis
- Luke vs Morgs
- MatthewR vs Cara
- Gavin vs Chris
- Darryan vs Alex
- Kevin vs Mack
- Dylan vs Divya
- Jesse vs Emma
- Matt vs John
- Coop vs Andrew
- Scott vs Matthew2
- Zach vs ZachA

Good luck this week!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Travis, Chris, Alex, Gavin
Fell off: Chris, Alex

Prefacing this ranking by saying that 8-10 were definitely not easy to pick lol.

10 - Dylan (NEW) - League A - Considering he is 3-0 in the league and 2-1 in the cup, I think it's fair to put Dylan on this list. However, I do think his defenders need to do some heavy lifting with the absolutely dire FWD situation on his team. And considering he is in 3rd, I'm not sure if many of the sought after FWDs will drop to him on waivers.

9 - Jesse (NEW) - League A - Another team in a weird state that I don't really know how to rank, Jesse lives and dies by Manchester City's performance. Certainly he gets minus points for the Cherki, Ben White, and Sarr injuries, but Isak should be getting minutes for Liverpool soon, so it evens out maybe?

8 - Zach (-3) - League A - Unfortunately for Zach, the freefall continues, with Aston Villa not scoring in August, Trafford losing his starting spot with the Donnarumma signing, and Saka/Gvardiol being who-knows-where. Add on the Guehi drama at Crystal Palace and I worry for his team moving forward. That said, Ekitike should get a few more starts and he seems to be finding solid scores these weeks so with how difficult it has been to fill these later slots on the power rankings, he stays.

7 - Mack (-) - League B - Even with the slight off week for Mack considering the random Elanga and Barnes rotation, I think Mack has a top 10 team. Eze picked up his first minutes in an Arsenal shirt, Strand Larsen is back from injury and is no longer contending with the transfer rumor mill, and surely Elanga starts next week, right?

6 - Matthew (-2) - League A - What could be better than a 1 point loss in week 2 and a 2 point loss in week 3? Maybe I'm biased but even with the conflicting sources regarding Solanke's injury, the pickups of Kluivert (returning from injury) and Wissa (moving to Newcastle) are pretty big upgrades in the long run. Plus, Jedi is back.

5 - MatthewR (+3) - League A - Had a difficult time rating MatthewR's team this week, especially considering 33 points came from 3 players, but he has come up with the most PF in League A, so obviously something is working.

4 - Luke (-1) - League A - Another solid week for Luke keeps him in the 40+ PF per week range and with Thiago nailed and Barry getting more minutes I think he maybe has a passable (although lower tier) group of FWDs ahead of his midfield. Also, Palmer should be back soon which is huge for him.

3 - Darryan (-1) - League A - Top of League A, 3 good FWDs, and a waiver wire with a plethora of MID options this week has Darryan sit just ahead of Luke in this ranking. The only negatives are Saliba out for 3-4 weeks and Frimpong probably being eased back into the team. The only question is if he can keep winning with 2 pointers from his Arsenal players.

2 - ZachA (+3) - League B - With the highest PF in both leagues and an enormous 71 point week, ZachA has given me no choice but to push him further and further up the power rankings. And that's despite my distaste for the 25 points from his Chelsea DEF/GKP corps. That said, his bald midfielder is off the mark, Sarr is the Crystal Palace talisman with Eze gone (despite his injury seeming pretty bad), Wilson getting minutes, and Pedro being the undisputed number 9 at Chelsea with the Delap injury.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Back to form this week with a 42 pointer with only 7 points coming from a midfield of Salah, Rogers, and Kudus. Evanilson picked up his first goal of the season, Thiago no longer has a Wissa-shaped shadow behind him, and surely Salah scores against Burnley?

Good luck and I hope you enjoyed the international break!
