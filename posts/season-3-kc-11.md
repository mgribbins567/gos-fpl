Hello everyone and thank you for participating in the Kickoff Cup this season! I hope you had a great time and I am honored to congratulate Scott for his victory! He took the final 37-24 over me to pick up his first tournament win!

**Congratulations to Scott!**

Here's the _totally objective_ ranking of all managers after 10 weeks!

1. Scott
2. Matthew
3. Kevin
4. Zach
5. Darryan
6. Matt
7. Dylan
8. Soph
9. MatthewR
10. Luke
11. Gavin
12. Jesse
13. Rebecca
14. Coop
15. Andrew
16. Emily

Or, if you don't want the individual scores counted (each tier in alphabetical order):

1st: Scott

2nd: Matthew

3rd-4th: Kevin, Zach

5th-8th: Darryan, Dylan, Matt, Soph

9th-16th: Andrew, Coop, Emily, Gavin, Jesse, Luke, MatthewR, Rebecca

And as a reminder of the seeding coming into the season (new managers in alphabetical order):

1. Matthew
2. Luke
3. Dylan
4. Gavin
5. MatthewR
6. Darryan
7. Kevin
8. Scott
9. Jesse
10. Andrew
11. Zach
12. Emily
13. Coop
14. Matt
15. Rebecca
16. Soph

<br />

And, in case anyone was curious how many coefficient points were earned throughout this tournament:

- 8: Matthew
- 7: Scott
- 5: Darryan, Dylan, Matt
- 4: Kevin
- 3: Rebecca
- 2: Andrew, MatthewR, Soph
- 1: Coop, Gavin, Jesse, Luke, Zach
- 0: Emily

Again, no concrete plans for how these will be used in the future (apart from seeding cool things like kickoff tournaments!) so for now, just fun numbers based on the amount of wins everyone got between the groups and knockout stages.

Also, a quick prizing update, we've had 2 manager of the month awards added to the pool, along with a portion of Scott's prize from this tournament. Shoutout me for the contributions and the winners of the prizes (MatthewR, myself, and Scott), for deciding to redirect that cash into the prize pool! Here's the new breakdown:

Total Pot: $655

1st: $327.50 + Jersey

2nd: $163.75

3rd: $98.25

4th: $65.50

Phew, I think that's all the bookkeeping.

And as a sneak peak into the next tournament, perhaps you should refer to last season's <u>[December Cup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cz9ArNdcdyjYWRvl9d2zBRdLVpbzuKW8gMSnZwGMw9I/edit?gid=526765508#gid=526765508)</u>. The format is _slightly_ different, but the length will be the same! Also, more unforgiving than the Kickoff Cup. More information to come soon :)
