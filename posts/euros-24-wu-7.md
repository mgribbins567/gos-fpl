Hello all and thank you to everyone who participated in this short summer Euros fantasy league! It was a fun little side league and I will definitely run more of these in the Summer breaks for tournaments in the future! The congratulations this week are twofold- the first is a huge congratulations to Spain winning their 4th Euros 2-1 against England! Lamine Yamal picked up his 4th assist of the tournament for a Nico Williams goal and Oyarzabal finished off England in the 86th with a well worked goal. England's sole goal was from Cole Palmer, whose 2 g/a in less than 90 minutes played may confound some viewers and leave them wondering - _why is he not starting?_ In any case, he will surely be starting weekly in ~1 month's time!

Our second congratulations is to Zach! He picked up the 1st place trophy, staving off a comeback from me in these final weeks. He put up a very solid performance in this league and has made amends for his dubious finish in FPL last season. With 373 points, his finish was good for 224k place overall and a 6 point greater performance above me, who finished 2nd. Zach scored the league-high points in 3/7 weeks, building off of a very impressive 71 points in week 1. His other league-high scores came in week 3 with 51 points and week 5 with 52. A very impressive display and kudos to Zach!

Again, thanks everyone for playing and I hope you enjoyed the tournament!

A quick side-note/reminder regarding the Fantasy Premier League season- the first Gameweek starts on Friday, August 16th, so I will be hosting the draft that week (sometime between the 10th and the 15th, likely the 11th based on early responders), to allow for as many real-life transfers to occur before we draft players. The Fantasy PL rulers have begun releasing player prices for the official gamemode (more info in the <u>[New Player Primer](/posts/new-player-primer)</u> if you're curious what this is), which means that draft mode leagues and the full game will drop soon. Likely on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. Once the league has been created, you will be able to join and I will send out a form requesting everyone's availability for the Draft!
