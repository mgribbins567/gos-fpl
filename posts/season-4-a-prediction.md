Hello everyone and welcome to Game of Stones Season 4! While waiting for the game to drop, I figured it would maybe be fun to do a little way-too-soon predictions! If you want, feel free to fill out the form here if you'd like to make your own predictions before reading! These will be based on coefficient, historic performance, vibes, etc. and I guess can serve as some sort of early power ranking :)

This is all just for fun and to share a little bit of the new coefficient system and also how the power rankings will probably look once we get started!

<u>https://forms.gle/XJbUVGZx8LSsjX5J9</u>

And without further ado, let's jump right in!

### 12. Coop - 5.33 points

Past Results:

- Season 3: 13th, 42 points

Unfortunately, someone has to finish 12th and sadly that is where I have to put Coop. After a less than convincing first season, he really can only go up from here (and not just because there are only 12 teams). I do think that with a season under his belt he will have a more solid draft, but I worry that the steep level of competition might be a bit too much.

### 11. Scott - 14.39

Past Results:

- Season 1: 7th, 64 points
- Season 2: 7th, 55 points
- Season 3: 10th, 48 points

Scott has not had a bad season in the past 3 years, always able to find himself finishing in midtable. I do think this year might be the year we see him falter, as he narrowly escaped the relegation battle at the end of last season. Who knows though, he seems like he might have some plot armor that will keep him around.

### 10. Jesse - 14.89

Past Results:

- Season 1: 4th, 65 points
- Season 2: 9th, 48 points
- Season 3: 12th, 47 points

Maybe the most entertaining manager to watch on any given week, Jesse sure loves wheeling and dealing with his team. Has it panned out in the past... hard to tell. Like Scott, Jesse has been taking an unfortunate trajectory over the past 3 years and I hope I am not called in to protect him from himself with admin trade veto-ing enabled.

### 9. Zach - 12.83

Past Results:

- Season 2: 11th, 44 points
- Season 3: 8th, 54 points

One of the few managers trending upward, so I could definitely see him overperforming my prediction and fighting in the top half. However, something just hasn't clicked for him the past 2 seasons even with all the ball knowledge, so who knows. Maybe Zach is just cursed.

### 8. Dylan - 22.19

Past Results:

- Season 1: 3rd, 76 points
- Season 2: 4th, 64 points
- Season 3: 11th, 47 points

Was last season a blip? I certainly think so, but Dylan has been a manager with two sides. If he locks in like he did in seasons 1 and 2, he has a great chance to be in and around the top half, but after last season I'm considering that an _if_.

### 7. Matt - 14.93

Past Results:

- Season 3: 4th, 74 points

In his freshman year, Matt had a very solid outing with Haaland at the wheel. Odds are he won't have an automatic FWD spot filled this season, so it'll be interesting to see how he does without that.

### 6. Gavin - 23.59

Past Results:

- Season 2: 3rd, 66 points
- Season 3: 6th, 66 points

Wow, didn't realize how consistent Gavin is. Guess we'll see another 66 point season from him then? Jokes aside, it gets really hard predicting the top 6. Gavin has been solid in his first two seasons (even without making many moves in the 2nd), and definitely has the potential to compete in the top half.

### 5. Darryan - 22.38

Past Results:

- Season 1: 1st, 88 points
- Season 2: 8th, 48 points
- Season 3: 9th, 50 points

Maybe my boldest prediction? After a pretty dominant Season 1 win followed by a lackluster Season 2 performance, Darryan just pulled the shortest straw imaginable in Season 3, yet still turned it around to finish 9th. I think in Season 4 he doesn't get as unlucky and builds a very solid team.

### 4. Kevin - 27.92

Past Results:

- Season 1: 9th, 48 points
- Season 2: 6th, 58 points
- Season 3: 2nd, 82 points

Another interesting trajectory, I do think Kevin will regress slightly without the Isak trade, but his steady improvement is surely noteworthy. I think he'll be able to carry last season's momentum, have a solid draft, and finish firmly toward the top.

### 3. MatthewR - 30.68

Past Results:

- Season 1: 6th, 64 points
- Season 2: 5th, 60 points
- Season 3: 1st, 89 points

All eyes on MatthewR's title defense, but I do think he'll fall just short this year. I do think he's a good manager, and consistently improving (like Kevin), but it's hard to say he'll get the same helping hand from the luck table this season.

### 2. Luke - 39.57

Past Results:

- Season 2: 2nd, 73 points
- Season 3: 3rd, 78 points

I have zero doubts that Luke will be in the title race once again this season. He fought his way to second in his first season, fell barely short of second in his second season, and I don't really see a world in which he falters much off that pace.

### 1. Matthew - 38.32

Past Results:

- Season 1: 2nd, 79 points
- Season 2: 1st, 82 points
- Season 3: 5th, 70 points

I mean, I'm slightly biased I guess and I very nearly put Luke ahead of me (the fact he's played 1 less season is huge for his coefficient), but I just couldn't. All 3 seasons at 70+ points and the third off the back of a multi-month long Saka injury. I don't think winning one of these is a straightforward prospect in the slightest, but I do think the betting odds would favor me slightly.
