Happy gameweek 3 of the Short n' Sweet cup and welcome to the final gameweek of the group stage! We will be saying goodbye to 4 teams after this week! But before we discuss who those names might be, let's check out some highlights from this week! Starting in Group A, Andrew upsets Gavin 24-22! Other notable upsets include Kevin's 45-36 win against Dylan in Group C, Darryan's 50-26 victory against Jesse, and FPL stealing away the draw (via Enes Unal suddenly losing a bonus point the day after the match) in my 29-30 loss to Coop. Full results are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR 43-20 Zach
- Gavin 22-24 Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt 41-22 Emily
- Rebecca 32-16 Scott

**Group C**

- Dylan 36-45 Kevin
- Luke 37-26 Soph

**Group D**

- Matthew 29-30 Coop
- Jesse 26-50 Darryan

Next week will see the following matchups:

**Group A**

- MatthewR vs Gavin
- Zach vs Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt vs Rebecca
- Emily vs Scott

**Group C**

- Dylan vs Luke
- Kevin vs Soph

**Group D**

- Matthew vs Jesse
- Coop vs Darryan

So, let's get into the fun part! The scenarios:

**Group A**

- 1 - 6 pts - MatthewR: Result confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a win or draw vs Gavin.
- 2 - 3 pts - Gavin: Can clinch the 1 seed with a 14 point win against MatthewR. A draw or win vs MatthewR confirms appearance in the knockouts.
- 3 - 3 pts - Andrew: A win or draw vs Zach confirms appearance in the knockouts. Very unlikely to be 1 seed. Can be 2 seed with Gavin loss or Gavin win and overcome 32 PF difference.
- 4 - 0 pts - Zach: A win vs Andrew confirms appearance in the knockouts. Very unlikely to be the 2 seed(24 PF difference).

**Group B**

- 1 - 6 pts - Rebecca: Result confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a win or draw vs Matt.
- 2 - 6 pts - Matt: Result confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a 3 point win vs Rebecca.
- 3 - 0 pts - Scott: A win or draw vs Emily confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can only be 3 seed.
- 4 - 0 pts - Emily: A 5 point win vs Scott confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can only be 3 seed.

**Group C**

- 1 - 6 pts - Kevin: Result confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a win or draw vs Soph.
- 2 - 3 pts - Luke: A win or draw vs Dylan confirms appearance in the knockouts. Very unlikely to be 1 seed (29 PF difference).
- 3 - 3 pts - Soph: A win or draw vs Kevin confirms appearance in the knockouts. Very unlikely to be 1 seed (53 PF difference). Can be 2 seed with Luke loss or Luke win and overcome 24 PF difference.
- 4 - 0 pts - Dylan: A 20 point win vs Luke confirms appearance in the knockouts. A win vs Luke and Soph loss and overcome 5 PF difference with Soph confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can be 2 seed with first scenario and Soph loss.

**Group D**

- 1 - 6 pts - Darryan: Result confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a win or draw vs Coop.
- 2 - 3 pts - Coop: A win or draw vs Darryan confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can clinch the 1 seed with a 22 point win vs Darryan.
- 3 - 3 pts - Jesse: A win or draw vs me confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can be 1 seed with a win vs me and Darryan loss and overcome 22 PF difference with Darryan and 1 PF difference with Coop. Can be 2 seed with first scenario and Coop loss (or other million scenarios).
- 4 - 0 pts - Matthew: An 8 point win vs Jesse confirms appearance in the knockouts. Can be 2 seed with Coop loss and overcome 8 PF difference.

So, tons of scenarios and possibilities going into this final gameweek of the group stage! The most impactful and interesting matchups I'd say include Zach vs Andrew from Group A, both Rebecca vs Matt and Scott vs Emily have huge implications in Group B, Dylan vs Luke in Group C, and me vs Jesse should be an interesting one to track in Group D.
