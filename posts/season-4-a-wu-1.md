Hello everyone and happy gameweek 1 of Season 4! Waivers this week should be due on Thursday at 10:30am PDT / 1:30pm EDT, but for some reason it doesn't say that on the website. Regardless, I have two announcements to make here:

**Check your Status and Transactions tabs.** Unfortunately, there were some issues with drafting as a result of players not being added to watchlists, so teams got messed up. If you have a trade waiting for you, double check that the player(s) offered are not on your team and should be, and then accept. If you're uncertain, send me a screenshot and I can take a look.

Additionally, make sure that your team is correct! If you have any missing players who you drafted (and you don't have a trade initiated already for them), let me know! I think I found all the cases of missing players, but it is possible that I missed a couple. (Note that in the B league a couple of you are stuck in a multi-party sequential trade due to goalkeeper auto-draft madness - I have a plan to rescue you). **Do this soon so that teams will be correct for the first gameweek!**

**Do not waiver/sign players on this list:**

- Sesko
- Diakite
- Thiaw
- Masuaku
- Hermansen
- Broja

We are implementing a new player waiver ban until the end of the transfer window, to ensure there are no tanking shenanigans or luck of the draw wins. Do not sign the above players to your team until after gameweek 3! If you are confused by this or have any questions about if a player can be added to your waivers, let me know! Thanks!

Anyway, about time we start the short Gameweek 1 update! Teams have been drafted and the league has been generated, so that means we have fixtures! Highlights for this week include our 1st overall pick Darryan going up against Kevin, Zach vs Gavin kicking us off for the second year in a row, and a battle between two Season 3 juggernauts in Luke vs Matt. Full matchups are as follows:

- Coop vs Matthew
- Gavin vs Zach
- Darryan vs Kevin
- Jesse vs Scott
- Dylan vs MatthewR
- Luke vs Matt

And unfortunately, I've not _quite_ fleshed out the kickoff cup (name still pending), so that announcement will have to come in another post! Stay tuned!
