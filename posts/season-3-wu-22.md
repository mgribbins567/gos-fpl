This week sees widespread changes across the table, just showing how close the competition is up and down the table! Starting at the top, MatthewR's loss drops his lead to only 12 points over Matt, who has himself developed a 6 point lead over Kevin and I. Luke's loss puts him 1 point behind alongside Zach, who leapfrogs Jesse by a point to join Luke on 36. Jesse now sits just 5 points above Gavin in 8th, who has passed Dylan by a pair of points. Dylan is joined now on 28 by Soph, who moves ahead of Coop and Emily by a point. They are now just 1 point ahead of Darryan, whose win takes his 2 ahead of Rebecca.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week has an interesting composition, with 3 15+ pointers and 3 8 pointers making the list.

- Matthew: Antoine Semenyo - The main man for strikerless Bournemouth picked up his 6th goal (which was a great finish) and 3rd FPL assist of the season to find 2 bonus points and 12 total in their 2-2 draw against Chelsea.
- Zach: Justin Kluivert - As the beneficiary of Semenyo's assist, Kluivert scored an important goal from a penalty (and a bonus point) to find 8 points and lead Zach's team to the win over MatthewR.
- Kevin: Alexander Isak - Controversy rages on as Isak grabs 2 goals, an assist, and 3 bonus points to score in his 8th straight game and find 16 more points for Kevin.
- Matt: Maxence Lacroix - Proving to be the difference maker in a close matchup, Lacroix once again picks up a crucial clean sheet and 2 bonus points for 8 total as Crystal Palace hold Leicester goalless.
- Gavin: Jean-Philippe Mateta - On the other end of the pitch, Mateta mimics Lacroix's performance with his own 8 pointer from a goal and 2 bonus points as well. Huh, what an interesting mirror from these first 5 game changers. (2 Bournemouth, Isak, 2 Crystal Palace) neat.
- Darryan: Phil Foden - I guess this continues the trend of a 15+ pointer going after players from the same team, as Foden picked up 2 goals against his most hated rival: Brentford (8 goals in 8 apps). Those, plus 3 bonus, hauled 15 points for Darryan.
- Scott: Leandro Trossard - Trossard's game winner against Tottenham that was definitely not a keeper mistake led Scott's team to the win this week with 9 total points (2 bonus).
- Soph: Amad Diallo - Unfortunately, not an Arsenal player, but this red shirted player had a doozy of a last 10 minutes, where he picked up a hat trick to win the game for Manchester United. Against Southampton. Nice. That's 20 points for Diallo though.

In terms of January Manager of the Month, we still have 5 undefeated teams at the halfway mark (sorry, I miscounted last update)! Kevin leads the pack with 111 PF followed by Zach (93), Darryan (83), Gavin (74), and Soph (69).

In terms of the form table, Kevin takes the top spot with 15/15 earned points! He is followed by Zach, Matt, and Soph who each have 12/15 in the past 5!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by Zach vs Luke! Elsewhere, we will see some interesting midtable clashes between Darryan and Coop and Gavin and Soph, alongside a top half battle between MatthewR and Jesse.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Scott (15) vs Matthew (4)
- Darryan (13) vs Coop (11)
- Gavin (8) vs Soph (10)
- Rebecca (14) vs Andrew (16)
- Kevin (3) vs Emily (12)
