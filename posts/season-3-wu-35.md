Happy gameweek 35! Waivers were due like 9 hours previous because there is a Friday game! And only 4 gameweeks left in the season! (If MatthewR wins this week or Matt loses we crown a winner!) Highlights from this week included the high scoring final Matthew Derby of the season where the longer-named Matthew took it 58-44. Elsewhere, Scott took a narrow yet necessary 17-15 win over Jesse, Darryan upset Matt 32-14, and Luke escaped Gavin narrowly in a 32-27 win.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 44-58 MatthewR
- Dylan 25-39 Kevin
- Zach 18-36 Rebecca
- Luke 32-27 Gavin
- Matt 14-32 Darryan
- Jesse 15-17 Scott
- Emily 64-26 Coop
- Andrew 16-29 Soph

This week sees a lot of intrigue around the relegation spots! But before that, let's start at the top, where Matt has dropped points, separated from Kevin and Luke by only 1 and 2 points, respectively. Meanwhile, my team decided it would have nothing to do with any of this moving up and down the table business as I sit 8 points off 4th and 7 points above 6th. yay. Anyway, Rebecca's win takes her just 3 points behind Zach and Gavin and gives her a shot at top 6. In the bottom half, Darryan makes a huge move with his third win in a row catapulting him up to 9th over Jesse on PF. Emily and Scott's wins move them both out of the drop zone, pushing Coop and Dylan into danger. Just below, Soph's win closes the gap as well, so she is now just 2 points from safety.

Now onto the Game Changers! Probably not going to be the most interesting write up because it's late as hell and the games were basically forever ago at this point (thanks Brentford and Nottingham Forest).

- MatthewR: Dan Burn - Of course the Fortnite-dancing, 7 foot tall fullback had to go and put up 13 points this week, picking up his first goal of the season against Ipswich in Newcastle's 3-0 win. He also grabbed clean sheet points and 2 bonus.
- Kevin: Kevin Schade - I don't think this is the first time Kevin's namesake has featured on this list (though I think that Kevin was from a little further West). The Brentford man did pick up a goal and clean sheet point in Brentford's 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest for 8 total points.
- Rebecca: Mark Flekken - Just a long list of things Flekken did right this week including pulling an Ederson with an assist, picking up a clean sheet, 5 saves, and 3 bonus points (that's 13 points).
- Luke: Kieran Trippier - Very fortunate week for Luke who's entire team took a break, except for Trippier, who put in a shift and a half with 15 points from 2 assists, a clean sheet, and 3 bonus points.
- Darryan: Rasmus Hojlund - With his 4th goal of the season, the prolific Danish striker picked up the only United goal in their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth and 3 bonus points, for a 9 point return to Darryan.
- Scott: Alexis Mac Allister - With the league winning screamer, Mac Allister picked up 3 bonus points and a key total of 10 for Scott this week.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - Even with the Manchester United rumors, the Brazilian continues to cook, this time picking up a goal, 2 assists, and 3 bonus points in Wolves' 3-0 win against Leicester.
- Soph: Robert Sanchez - Didn't watch this game, but I'm not surprised Everton didn't score. Chelsea won 1-0, Sanchez got 9 points from a clean sheet, 3 saves, and 2 bonus, and I heard absolutely nothing about the 90 minutes that were played.

Congrats to Luke for winning April manager of the month! He took it on PF over Kevin! And welcome to May! Just 4 weeks left :)

- Coop (13) vs Matthew (5)
- Scott (12) vs Soph (15)
- Darryan (9) vs Andrew (16)
- Gavin (7) vs Emily (11)
- Rebecca (8) vs Jesse (10)

<br/>

- Lots of movement this week, with Darryan leaping up to 9th. With the easiest remaining schedule, you'd think he has a great chance of making some space away from the drop line
- Jesse and Emily do not have fun remaining schedules, Scott, Coop, and even Soph could pick up points and quickly overtake them
- Scott has a great opportunity to move ahead this week against Soph, with Jesse and Emily against Rebecca and Gavin, respectively
- If Soph beats Scott, she will move ahead of him (and with Coop + Dylan losses out of relegation!)

Shoutout this week to Luke for 8 wins in a row! Also shoutouts to Kevin for a 5 winstreak, Darryan for 3 in a row, MatthewR for 3 undefeated (2W1D), and Scott for back to back wins!
