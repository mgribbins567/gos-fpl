- Netherlands vs England

This is one of the most on-paper strong final four of recent years, and I'm excited to see who makes it to the final! Except if it's England and France, in which case I will enjoy the 2 hour long nap it will provide. Otherwise, Spain has continued to impress, knocking off a quite good German side who could have had Toni Kroos sent off about 3 times over and the Netherlands continue their trend of playing horrifically in one half before putting it all together in the second half.

In terms of our league, Zach looks near unbeatable, with a high-score of the week 52 points, taking his total up to 311. This puts him impressively at 75k overall and gives him a 23 point lead over myself. This week, his team was led by a Rodri captain choice earning 10 points, along with 22 total points from the Portugal and France 0-0 draw. As mentioned before, I continue my solid campaign with a 44 point haul to take me up to 288, a 24 point gap above 3rd. From there, just 12 points separate 3rd and 7th, so there is a good chance of movement on the final matchday.
