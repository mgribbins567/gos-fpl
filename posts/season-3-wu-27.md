Happy gameweek 27! These gameweeks are moving quickly as waivers are due tomorrow at 10am PST / 1pm EST! This week saw some close matchups and a surprise result or two, led by Dylan's narrow 29-27 victory over Soph! I also picked up a close 34-30 win against Gavin, Emily upset Luke 39-24, and Matt notched the biggest win of the season against Jesse, 67-14.

Full results are as follows:

- Gavin 30-34 Matthew
- Rebecca 61-43 Darryan
- Kevin 45-34 Scott
- MatthewR 49-28 Coop
- Dylan 29-27 Soph
- Zach 35-26 Andrew
- Luke 24-39 Emily
- Matt 67-14 Jesse

This week sees a bit of movement across the table. Our top 3 continue their winning ways, but instead of Luke in 4th it's me! Once again we have traded places, and Zach rejoins the pack at 45 and 46 points. Newcomer to the top half Rebecca leapfrogs Gavin (on PF) and Jesse (by 1 point), sitting 6 points behind. A bit further down, Dylan's win this week takes him 2 points above Darryan and out of the relegation zone.

Now onto the Game Changers! 2 new faces and 6 old ones this week!

- Matthew: Kaoru Mitoma - Despite carrying my team in recent weeks, the Japanese international somehow hadn't made his way onto this list until now! This week he picked up a goal and clean sheet point to lead my team with 8 whole points, and see Brighton beat Southampton 4-0.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - 10th appearance on this list (out of 13th possible). Not much to say other than he's already got the player of the season trophy and almost definitely going to win the Ballon d'Or, right? Goal, assist, clean sheet point, and 3 bonus against Manchester City in Liverpool's 2-0 win. 14 more points which, may I add, is actually _under_ his average for the game changers table. Washed?
- Kevin: Alexander Isak - Isak shakes off the rust from the past couple of weeks and puts in a pair of goals against Nottingham Forest to lead Newcastle to a 4-3 victory (and pick up 3 bonus and 13 total points for Kevin). If I had a time machine...
- MatthewR: Dominik Szoboszlai - In what honestly probably should have been the 3 bonus point performance, the Hungarian put in a monster shift, picking up a goal and assist, clean sheet point, 2 bonus, and probably 15 kilometers of running. He led MatthewR's team with 13 points.
- Dylan: Jarrod Bowen - Dylan's compensation for the toothless Arsenal attack is a Bowen 10 pointer, as he scored the lone goal in West Ham's 1-0 upset. That earned him 2 bonus and led Dylan's team to a narrow win.
- Zach: Bruno Fernandes - Meanwhile, Zach gets to celebrate his team coming back to draw Everton 2-2 with his own 10 pointer from the United captain. His points came from a scored direct free kick leading to 3 bonus points.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - The Wolves talisman picked up his 13th goal of the season (and 6th appearance on this list - 3rd most!) to lead his team to a 1-0 win against 10-man Bournemouth. He totalled 9 points from the goal and 3 bonus points.
- Matt: Marco Asensio - Matt's monster week came off the back of the ex-Real Madrid Villain's brace to come back from behind and beat Chelsea 2-1. In what was an inspired signing both by Matt and Aston Villa, Asensio earned 3 bonus and 15 total points.

With just one week left in February, Rebecca has kept her enormous PF lead at the top, with just Kevin and MatthewR as the managers who can take advantage if she drops points against Scott this week.

<br/>

In terms of the form table, Rebecca takes the top spot alongside Kevin with 15/15 points earned! Matt and MatthewR are the only 2 managers on 12/15 pointers from the past 5.

Next week will see some great(uhh) matchups, headlined by yet another key Matt(hew) derby between me and Matt! Elsewhere, there's not a lot of matches that are close on the table... so we've got Andrew vs Dylan and Darryan vs Gavin I guess?

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (4) vs Matt (2)
- Jesse (9) vs Luke (5)
- Emily (11) vs Zach (6)
- Andrew (16) vs Dylan (12)
- Soph (14) vs MatthewR (1)
- Coop (10) vs Kevin (3)
- Scott (15) vs Rebecca (7)
- Darryan (13) vs Gavin (8)

Shoutout this week to Kevin for his now 10 winstreak! Also shoutouts to Rebecca for 5 in a row, MatthewR for 3, and Matt for picking up back to back victories!
