Happy gameweek 4 of the Short n' Sweet cup and welcome to the Round of 12!! This week saw our final group stage matches and finalized the first round of the bracket! So let's get started with some results. Starting with a Group A shootout where Gavin upset MatthewR 60-48! Elsewhere in Group B, we had two close matches: Dylan 29-24 Luke and Kevin taking a narrow 40-37 win over Soph. Group D saw a similar 3 point match, as Jesse beat me 30-27. Final results are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR 48-60 Gavin
- Zach 44-15 Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt 42-24 Rebecca
- Emily 18-45 Scott

**Group C**

- Dylan 29-24 Luke
- Kevin 40-37 Soph

**Group D**

- Matthew 27-30 Jesse
- Coop 31-41 Darryan

So, what does this mean for the final groups? Well, starting at the top, MatthewR barely snuck into 1st in Group A by a single point over Gavin. Zach's win also placed him into the knockout stage over Andrew as 3rd seed of his group. Group B saw Matt take the top spot in the H2H win over Rebecca, while Scott's win over Emily secured him the 3rd slot. In Group C, Kevin's win secured him the top spot, and along with Dylan's win, the final 3 managers were competing for 2 slots on PF. And with just a 3 PF difference, Soph joined Kevin and Luke, knocking Dylan out of the group. And in Group D, the upsets don't stop as Jesse's win over me this week knocks me out in groups, ending my 3 cup finals streak. This also secured Jesse the 2nd spot in the group, as Darryan took 1st with his win against Coop.

As a reminder, the 1st place finishers all get byes from the Round of 12! This means MatthewR, Matt, Kevin, and Darryan all get this week off in the cup! Who will they play?

**Round of 12 - Left Side**

- MatthewR: Winner of Luke vs Scott

- Matt: Winner of Jesse vs Soph

<br />

**Round of 12 - Right Side**
