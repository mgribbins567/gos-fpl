Hello everybody and happy Gameweek 1! The Premier League kickoff match is this Friday at noon (Pacific) / 3 (Eastern), so waivers are due on Thursday at like 10:30am PDT / 1:30pm EDT or something. If you are new to the league and would like to learn more about waivers, check out the <u>[New Player Primer section on waivers](/posts/new-player-primer#waivers)</u>! Roster lock has actually been moved from 1 hour before gametime to 1.5 hour, so for old-heads who make last minute changes, take that into account. Anyway, usually I'd use this forum to talk about results of the week, upcoming matches, stats, copium, whatever, but this time, we have a draft to review! I've received a couple of requests for this, so why not?

Also, I really hope to not offend anybody- I understand that everyone has different levels of ~seriousness~ that they are drafting at, so I'm going to do my best to take that into account! That said, I do think it'll be fun to share my thoughts on everyone's draft. Plus, if you feel you didn't do well in the draft, you can always find and waiver in the next Cole Palmer (or recreate him in the aggregate).

~ 12 hours later ~

So, at the time of writing this, I've spent about 2 hours furiously typing and have gotten through... 10 managers. I've once again written a damn novel. Anyway, there are other things I want to include in this update so I've offloaded the ramblings of a mad man <u>[to its own blog post](/posts/season-3-draft-review)</u>. I've also added a table of contents, so that you can skip to whoever you want to read about. Again, they are in varying levels of tongue-in-cheek and I really do think that everyone has upside to their drafts (in a serious way). In a non-serious way, some drafts have _way_ more upside.

### Gameweek 1 Matchups

Regardless, let's cover the upcoming week of matchups! Highlights include a Gribbins derby between myself and Andrew (probably one of the most lopsided matchups historically :( ), Darryan taking on Luke in what should be an interesting, potentially Foden-less battle between two historically excellent managers, Gavin facing off against Zach, and Kevin taking on MatthewR. Honestly, some great matchups for drama this week and I'm excited to see how everyone kicks off. The full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew vs Matthew
- Soph vs Emily
- Coop vs Jesse
- Scott vs Matt
- Darryan vs Luke
- Gavin vs Zach
- Rebecca vs Dylan
- Kevin vs MatthewR

### Kickoff Cup Matchups

In the future, I may separate this section into a separate post / announcement, but for now, welcome to the Kickoff Cup! I've gone through and made sure that nobody has any instances of playing the same manager twice, so the group stage has been set! If you haven't seen the announcement, go [read/watch it here](/posts/kickoff-tournament-24)! I've also updated [the Season 3 page](/pages/history/season_24_25) with the groups! We have some great matchups this week, highlighted by the Group D headliner Luke vs Matt. These two teams had great drafts and I'm really interested to see them face off. Group B's Gavin vs Kevin matchup will also be one to keep an eye on as Kevin's 3rd pick Solanke will take the field in a Spurs uniform for the first time. Full matchups are as follows:

Group A

- Matthew vs Soph
- Darryan vs Jesse

Group B

- Gavin vs Kevin
- Andrew vs Coop

Group C

- Dylan vs Scott
- Zach vs Rebecca

Group D

- Luke vs Matt
- MatthewR vs Emily

And with that, our first week is set! Everyone will be playing in 2 competitions for the first 5 weeks so enjoy the matches and good luck!
