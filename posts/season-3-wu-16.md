Happy gameweek 16 and that's a wrap on the first set of matchups! Since 15 gameweeks have passed, each manager has played every other manager once so we're back to the gameweek 1 matchups! This week, not a ton ended up happening on the table, but there were some close matchups! Leading the line is Jesse's narrow 26-24 win over Andrew and Zach's 20-16 win against Scott. Elsewhere, Darryan picked up a huge 50 pointer to take the upset over Dylan's 36 points and Kevin upset Rebecca 45-32.

Full results are as follows:

- Emily 22-29 Matthew
- Andrew 24-26 Jesse
- Soph 26-41 Matt
- Coop 30-37 Luke
- Scott 16-20 Zach
- Darryan 50-36 Dylan
- Gavin 22-43 MatthewR
- Rebecca 32-45 Kevin

<br/>

These results result in exactly one table change: Dylan dropping to 6th as me and Luke pick up the 3 points this week. Other notable movements include Zach and Kevin closing the gap with the top 7 (with the former tied for 7th on points, behind on PF) and Darryan bringing his gap behind the group from 10th-12th to just 1 point.

Now onto the Game Changers! Fairly low scoring with a similar look to last week!

- Matthew: Mohammed Kudus - Kudus has overcome his idiocy and in his second game back from suspension got an assist and 2 bonus points for a 7 pointer! Finally, an attacking return for my team, and the highest scorer for me this week.
- Jesse: Jamie Vardy - With almost half of his 26 points this week, Vardy puts up a vintage performance with a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points against Brighton. A 12 pointer just enough to secure Jesse the win this week.
- Matt: Bryan Mbeumo - With Mbeumo's 3rd double digit haul this season including his 9th goal and 2nd assist, he leads Matt's team to victory with a huge 13 points.
- Luke: Jadon Sancho - A sudden Sancho start over Madueke in a 4-3 thriller against Tottenham led to a goal and bonus point for Luke, leading his team with an important 8 points this week.
- Zach: Bruno Fernandes - Some consolation for Zach, as his United player brings home 9 points from a goal and 2 bonus in their loss to Nottingham Forest this weekend. Maybe Amorim tries him at wing back next weekend?
- Darryan: Enzo Fernandez - In what's looking to be an inspired waiver for Darryan, Enzo picks up his 3rd goal in 4 games along with 2 bonus points to lead Darryan's team with 9 points and his first 50+ score of the season!
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - I'm tired of writing this guy's name, man. Set the record for most penalties scored in a row from start of career (12) with a penalty he thought he hit wide + a panenka. Also an assist that some may say was dubiously awarded. And 3 bonus. 18 points gtfoh.
- Kevin: Morgan Gibbs-White - Another great waiver pickup on this list, MGW picked up a goal and assist (and 3 bonus) against United this weekend to make the difference for Kevin with 13 points.

The December Manager of the Month race sees Kevin expand his lead on PF to 21! Other managers on 6 points include MatthewR, Matt, Luke, Jesse, and Zach. Still plenty of month to go!

In terms of the form table, MatthewR takes his place back at the top with 15/15 points earned! He's followed by Kevin, me, and Zach with 12/15.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by the two teams at the top of the form table: Kevin vs MatthewR! Elsewhere, we will have a Gribbins derby in which I will look to take revenge for GW1, and midtable matchups in Zach vs Gavin and Rebecca vs Dylan.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Andrew (16) vs Matthew (5)
- Soph (14) vs Emily (12)
- Coop (11) vs Jesse (3)
- Scott (15) vs Matt (2)
- Darryan (13) vs Luke (4)
- Gavin (10) vs Zach (8)
- Rebecca (7) vs Dylan (6)
- Kevin (9) vs MatthewR (1)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 5 winstreak! Shoutouts also to Kevin and Zach who have picked up 3 winstreaks, and Jesse, Luke, and Matt for their 2 winstreaks!
