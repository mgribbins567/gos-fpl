Full results are as follows:

- Divya 30-58 Matthew

<br/>

These results see me take top spot, followed by Zach, Chris, Emma, and Cara, who all notched 40+ point wins!

Next up, the first set of game changers! For League B, these will either be abbreviated compared to the League A version or maybe just a one liner or something (mostly so I can save some time typing) (if you see who your game changer is and want to do a quick couple sentences and send it to me before I send out the update that would also work for future weeks :eyes:) (a game changer is the player on the winning team who scores the most points, and for tie breaker I do whoever has the higher bps)

- Matthew: Chris Wood - 13 pts - 2 goals for the Kiwi, including a fantastic volley. Long gone are the days of Nottingham Forest scoring only 1 goal in preseason.
- Morgs: Rico Lewis - 11 pts - Honestly, didn't even think he'd start but he had a fantastic assist.
- Cara: Hugo Ekitike - 11 pts - What a performance honestly. Sat down Petrovic on his goal and just looked so solid. Also, holy hell this guy is tall.
- Emma: Guglielmo Vicario - 9 pts - Who knew Spurs would keep a clean sheet in this game. Hell, last year they would've lost probably. Have they turned a corner? discuss.
- ZachA: Rayan Ait-Nouri - 9 pts - Of course he does well against the team he just left. twas written in the stars.
- Chris: William Saliba - 9 pts - Shaky 1-0 win for Arsenal to start off the season with a clean sheet. we take those. On the other hand United looked pretty good.

In terms of our first week of 3 in the August Manager of the Month race, the table matches to table above, so not much to say there. I lead! But obviously can't win any prizes so ZachA, Chris, Emma, and Cara are all in with a shot!

Next week will see what should be some close matchups, headlined by me vs Chris in what should be a high scoring match. Elsewhere, similarly scoring teams pair off, including Mack looking to pick up her first 3 points against Emma, Alex vs Travis to determine who will get their first win, and Cara vs Morgs go head to head in a battle to stay undefeated.

- Matthew vs Chris
- John vs ZachA
- Mack vs Emma
- Alex vs Travis
- Cara vs Morgs
- Andrew vs Divya

# The League

Welcome to gameweek 2 of 8 in The League(tm) group stage! This week saw a number of dramatic matches, led by Alex's single point victory over Morgs 38-37. Elsewhere, League A managers Darryan and Jesse put up a high scoring week in which Jesse took the win, 49-44, Chris picked up his own 3 points in a narrow 44-40 win against Cara, and Luke slipped by Scott 36-32. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 38-45 Zach
- Luke 36-32 Scott
- MatthewR 41-29 Coop
- Gavin 43-28 Matt
- Darryan 44-49 Jesse
- Kevin 36-42 Dylan
- Andrew 36-22 John
- Matthew2 58-42 Emma
- ZachA 48-30 Divya
- Travis 35-44 Mack
- Morgs 37-38 Alex
- Cara 40-44 Chris

How does that reflect on the table? Well, Matthew2 (my B league team) takes first with 58 PF, followed by Jesse (A), ZachA (B), and Zach (A) sitting in the top 4 slots. Again, early days so there will be much movement in the coming weeks!

And speaking of coming weeks, next week will be highlighted by MatthewR and Zach, who are both looking to be one of the first teams to sit on 6 points. Other key matchups include high scorers Darryan and Dylan facing off, ZachA vs Alex in what should be an interesting match against two winning teams, and what should be another close matchup from the B league in Cara vs Mack. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew vs Scott
- Luke vs Coop
- MatthewR vs Zach
- Gavin vs Jesse
- Darryan vs Dylan
- Kevin vs Matt
- Andrew vs Emma
- Matthew2 vs Divya
- ZachA vs Alex
- Travis vs John
- Morgs vs Chris
- Cara vs Mack

Good luck with your final intra-league matchup of the group stage!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Dylan, Gavin, Kevin, MatthewR, Alex, Andrew
Fell off: Andrew, Kevin

10 - Jesse (NEW) - League A - What a week 1 performance from Jesse with 49 points, I had no choice but to include him on this list. The only reason he isn't higher is because I'm unsure if his players will repeat this consistently, but I will _happily_ continue moving him up the board if they do.

9 - Chris (NEW) - League B - A solid 44 point performance from Chris this week with high value players such as Watkins not returning, meaning he has depth to his team.

8 - ZachA (+2) - League B - Similar situation to Jesse in that his performance was great with 48 points, but that's with 3 Chelsea defenders getting clean sheets. I still think he has a solid team, but I'd like to see more from his midfield (Cherki being his only return) before he advances further up this list.

7 - Cara (+1) - League B - As expected, Cara did very well this week (40 points) with points coming from a variety of sources (and with 13 points from Richarlison on the bench). Well deserving to move up a spot.

6 - Mack (+1) - League B - Pulled the short straw this week going up against ZachA and losing by 4 with the Kerkez drama and a 6 pointer waiting on the bench, yet still put up 44 points.

5 - Luke (-2) - League A - A rough week for Luke (38 points), with Palmer extending his cold (in a bad way) streak and the main source of points being Gakpo, Rutter, Romero, and Thiago. Think he still has a solid team, but with Marmoush not being immune to Pep shenanigans he needs more from Cole.

4 - Darryan (+2) - League A - The Haaland team showed up this week with a solid 44 points. Darryan was the other recipient of Slot's baldness, being the Frimpong owner who missed out on the +5, while also seeing a 13 pointer from Calafiori sit the bench. The 433 seems to work, depending on if he gets the Arsenal defenders shuffle correct.

3 - Matthew (+1) - League A - Debatable if I deserve to move _ahead_ of Luke, considering we scored the exact same number of points, but my reasoning is that only 1 of my first 4 picks returned this week and I still put up 38. And that's with 9 points on the bench and a player with 0 minutes on the field. I still think my team is very solid, especially if my FWDs can start scoring points.

2 - Zach (-) - League A - Despite the Konsa red card, Zach saw a 45 point week in which Saka, Rogers, and Elanga all did not return. Ekitike looks incredible, he's got 2 more starting FWDs, and still left 9 points on the bench. If there are gaps on this list, the biggest one is between 2 and 3.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - 58 points with an 8 pointer left on the bench. Not much to say about this one. Salah always returns on the first gameweek, Kudus showed up, and Haaland is a poor man's Chris Wood.

Again, these are kinda largely on vibes so feel free to disagree with me! And maybe one day I'll try my hand at making this into a graphic but today is not that day.

Good luck this week!
