Happy gameweek 6 of the kickoff cup and welcome to the quarterfinals! We have eliminated 50% of the teams and are moving into yet another two-legged round. But first, how did those matchups from last week turn out?

Well, they just about all went the same as the first week. Which is kinda expected in the Round of 16 and means the seeding worked. The one exception was the Kevin vs Rebecca matchup, where Kevin did overcome a 5 point deficit to take the tie 58-52. We also had two "upsets" based on the group stage rankings: Zach, 4th seed from Group C, defeated Andrew, 1st seed from Group B 53-42 on aggregate and Soph, 4th seed from Group A, took a convincing 110-82 aggregate win over MatthewR, the 1-seed from Group D (and 1st place in the league table) - quite the impressive result! Full results are as follows:

**Left Side**

- Matthew 67-40 Emily
- Dylan 80-67 Gavin

<br />

- Matt 94-62 Jesse
- Andrew 42-53 Zach

**Right Side**

- Scott 64-52 Coop
- Darryan 79-72 Luke

<br />

- Kevin 58-52 Rebecca
- MatthewR 82-110 Soph

The resulting bracket has quite the set of matchups, headlined by my and Dylan's double-header first leg in the league and the cup. Full matchups are as follows:

**Left Side**

- Matthew vs Dylan
- Matt vs Zach

<br />

**Right Side**

- Scott vs Darryan
- Kevin vs Soph

<br />
