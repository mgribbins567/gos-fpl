Hello everyone and happy gameweek 1 of Season 4! Waivers this week should be due on Thursday at 10:30am PDT / 1:30pm EDT, but for some reason it doesn't say that on the website. Regardless, I have two announcements to make here:

**Check your Status and Transactions tabs.** Unfortunately, there were some issues with drafting as a result of players not being added to watchlists, so teams got messed up. If you have a trade waiting for you, double check that the player(s) offered are not on your team and should be, and then accept. If you're uncertain, send me a screenshot and I can take a look.

Additionally, make sure that your team is correct! If you have any missing players who you drafted (and you don't have a trade initiated already for them), let me know! I think I found all the cases of missing players, but it is possible that I missed a couple. (Note that in the B league a couple of you are stuck in a multi-party sequential trade due to goalkeeper auto-draft madness - I have a plan to rescue you). **Do this soon so that teams will be correct for the first gameweek!**

**Do not waiver/sign players on this list:**

- Sesko
- Diakite
- Thiaw
- Masuaku
- Hermansen
- Broja

We are implementing a new player waiver ban until the end of the transfer window, to ensure there are no tanking shenanigans or luck of the draw wins. Do not sign the above players to your team until after gameweek 3! If you are confused by this or have any questions about if a player can be added to your waivers, let me know! Thanks!

If you have any issues with navigating the site or anything, feel free to either reach out or take a look at the <u>[New Player Primer](/posts/new-player-primer)</u>! There is a section on navigation (albeit using the old UI), along with misc. other things like waivers, following along with the premier league, and more!

Anyway, welcome to gameweek 1! For those of you who are new here, usually these are a little bit (read: a lot) longer, but since I don't have a lot to say we can start with the matchups for the week! This week's highlights see the 'Cole Palmer team' owned by Travis take on a surprisingly well done auto-draft from Cara, Season 1 returner ZachA take on Mack in his first matchup in years, two brand new faces in Chris and John square off, and finally, our first Gribbins derby between me and Divya! Full matchups are as follows:

- Divya vs Matthew
- Morgs vs Andrew
- Travis vs Cara
- Emma vs Alex
- ZachA vs Mack
- Chris vs John

And unfortunately, I don't have a kickoff cup announcement just yet, so stay tuned! There is a section on mid-season tournaments in the New Player Primer, but the tldr is that I will use your scores in the league in my own, spreadsheetized tournament! These will be different matchups than the league (e.g. Divya could play against me and Andrew in the same week), so everyone has a bit more to play for!
