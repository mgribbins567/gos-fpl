The highest scoring matchup of the week saw Emily take 3 points over Scott in her 55-44 win.

This week sees the rich get richer as there is just 1 mover in the table. Starting at the top we see the same setup as last week, but instead of the gap between 5th and 6th being just 1 point, it extends to 4. Kevin is the lone table climber as his win takes him above Dylan on PF and Zach by a point up to 6th. Further down, Coop and Emily's victories extend the gap above Darryan to 4 points as they join Gavin and Rebecca on 24 points.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week is tied for the 3rd lowest score of game changers with just 4 double digit returns on the list.

- Matthew: Anthony Elanga - Picking based on last week's points seemed to work for me as Elanga continued his scoring streak against Tottenham with a very tidy finish and the only goal in their 1-0 win. This goal, plus the cs point and 3 bonus points returned a huge 11 points this week.
- Coop: Joel Veltman - In a snoozer of a game against Brentford (that ended 0-0), Veltman picked up a clean sheet and 2 bonus points for a total of 8 fantasy points, leading Coop's comeback charge against Andrew and granting them a 1 point win this week.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - Apparently ban-pending Cunha is the second coming of Thierry Henry because that is 21 points since he elbowed an Ipswich staff member just a couple games ago. 12 of those came this week as he picked up a goal and rather selfless assist (along with 3 bonus) en route to Wolves' 2-0 win and huge week for Emily.
- Jesse: Anthony Gordon - Following a quite sketchy Jhon Duran red card, Newcastle ran rampant in their 3-0 win over Villa, featuring a Gordon goal and clean sheet point for 2 bonus and 10 total points for Jesse.
- Matt: Bernardo Silva - Silva's lone goal for Manchester City in their 1-1 draw against Everton was enough to cancel out the Haaland penalty miss for Matt as he returns 9 points and leads his team to a narrow win against Gavin this week.
- Luke: Kai Havertz - Havertz returns to this list for the first time since Gameweek 1 with the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 win against Ipswich. That, plus a yellow and 2 bonus provided Luke with 7 points this week.
- Kevin: Bart Verbruggen - Bart joined Veltman on 2 bonus points in the 0-0 draw against Brentford, picking up points from the clean sheet and 3 saves as well for a total of 9.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - Palmer breaks his 2 week hiatus with his 7th appearance on this list from a goal and 3 bonus in Chelsea's 1-2 loss to Fulham this week. This 3 points of bonus proved to be the difference for MatthewR this week against Dylan.

With just 1 week left in December, it's all up to me to defeat MatthewR as he sits in pole position with 15/15 possible points. Should I win, Kevin, Matt, and Luke all have a shot at December Manager of the Month.

In terms of the form table, MatthewR remains at the top with 15/15 points earned! Just behind him sits Kevin, Matt, and Luke on 12/15 points earned over the past 5!
