Hello all and welcome to gameweek 7 and the first knockout round of the Champions Cup! Our second group stage results are in and our Group E managers' picks have been made, so let's do a quick recap!

**Group E**

Not much changed this week with Group E, with Zach's PF lead safely securing his top spot and Rebecca's win not enough to overtake Dylan.

- Rebecca 37-31 Zach
- Matt 40-30 Dylan

1. Zach | 6 pts | 113 PF
2. Matt | 6 pts | 93 PF
3. Dylan | 3 pts | 89 PF
4. Rebecca | 3 pts | 72 PF

**Group F**

Group F saw much the same as well, with Luke easily taking the top spot and Gavin securing second with his win over Kevin.

- MatthewR 27-44 Luke
- Kevin 28-51 Gavin

1. Luke | 9 pts | 136 PF
2. Gavin | 6 pts | 112 PF
3. MatthewR | 3 pts | 78 PF
4. Kevin | 0 pts | 76 PF

**Group G**

Following the pattern of Group F, Darryan secured his flawless first place finish this week, and Soph's huge week off the back of her Newcastle players was enough to defeat Scott and leap up to 2nd.

- Scott 34-38 Soph
- Darryan 40-19 Andrew

1. Darryan | 9 pts | 101 PF
2. Soph | 6 pts | 72 PF
3. Andrew | 3 pts | 66 PF
4. Scott | 0 pts | 69 PF

**Group H**

And finally, Group H, where I put up a group stage 2 high 143 PF to win the group. And interestingly, we have a tie between Coop and Emily this week! Leaving a very interesting points spread for this group.

- Coop 18-18 Emily
- Matthew 39-19 Jesse

1. Matthew | 9 pts | 143 PF
2. Emily | 4 pts | 85 PF
3. Coop | 4 pts | 72 PF
4. Jesse | 0 pts | 57 PF

That puts us in the Round of 16! This round is a best of 1, while the rest of the tournament is 2 legged ties. As promised, the managers in Group E had their pick of the bottom 6 finishers of the other groups, with the remainder of the matchups drawn so that no 'same seeds' play each other and group winners play lower seeds if there is an option. Those conditions resulted in the following bracket!

**Top Half**

- Zach vs Jesse
- Gavin vs MatthewR

- Rebecca vs Scott
- Luke vs Soph

**Bottom Half**

- Dylan vs Coop
- Darryan vs Emily

- Matt vs Andrew
- Matthew vs Kevin

Since no Group E managers opted to choose from Group F, that resulted in the Group F rematch between Gavin and MatthewR and a double header this week between Me and Kevin! On top of this, the survivor of the first match likely faces Zach, and the winner of the second most likely meets Matt in the quarter finals! Not an easy road for the 4 of us.

And that's about it! Reminder that there are consolation matches so everyone will play from here on out, but only the winner receives the prize!
