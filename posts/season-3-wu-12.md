Happy gameweek 12! Unfortunately, this early weekly update comes with sad news: there is yet another international break :(. That means waivers are due Friday, November 22nd at 3am PST / 6am EST. This week had mostly expected results, other than a huge 59-35 victory for Emily over Luke off the back of a Wolves 2-0 win over the weekend. Elsewhere, Matt took his matchup against Jesse 41-29, Rebecca narrowly defeated Darryan 31-27 in a dramatic match, and I bested Gavin 43-29.

Full results are as follows:

- Gavin 29-43 Matthew
- Rebecca 31-27 Darryan
- Kevin 44-25 Scott
- MatthewR 33-14 Coop
- Dylan 43-30 Soph
- Zach 49-36 Andrew
- Luke 35-59 Emily
- Matt 41-29 Jesse

<br/>

This week sees yet again a number of changes across the table. Probably not worth mentioning but MatthewR is still in 1st, this week with a 5 point lead over second. Unlike last week, however, Matt takes the #2 spot over Jesse with his head to head win. This puts Jesse 2 points behind Matt and 4 ahead of Dylan, whose win pulls him to 4th over Luke. Luke is now joined by myself and Rebecca on 18 points. 1 game back, Zach joins the top half in 8th, sharing a point total with Gavin. Darryan sits just 1 point behind the two, with Kevin's win moving him up to just 1 point behind Darryan, ahead of Scott and Coop. Lastly, Emily's win this week grants her 14th place over Soph.

Now onto the Game Changers! Sadly, we were just 2 points away this week from a full suite of double digit game changers.

- Matthew: Bernd Leno - In what I thought might be a risky choice between Leno and Fabianski, they both ended up giving me 9 points, so that's cool. A solid defensive performance from Fulham against Crystal Palace, Leno picked up a clean sheet, 4 saves, and 2 bonus points to garner 9 points for my team.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - Surprise surprise, the only player to have made this list 4 times (that's 4/6 of Rebecca's wins). This week, Salah picked up his 8th goal and 6th assist of the season against Aston Villa en route to a 14-pointer.
- Kevin: Alexander Isak - As _the trade_ starts tilting in Kevin's favor, Isak picks up a goal and an assist along with 2 bonus points to return 11 fantasy points and lead Kevin's team to a solid victory against Scott.
- MatthewR: Joao Pedro - In just a 25 minute cameo back from injury, Pedro picked up a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points against Manchester City to lead not only Brighton to the win, but MatthewR as well to his 10th win of the season.
- Dylan: Emile Smith Rowe - In probably ESR's best performance in a Fulham kit so far, he picked up a goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus points for a double digit fantasy haul (11), to make the difference for Dylan this week.
- Zach: Bruno Fernandes - I'm sure Zach will enjoy seeing Bruno listed here as much as Dylan with ESR, as his first round pick finally gets some points with a goal, 2 assists (1 off an own goal), a clean sheet, and 3 bonus points on his way to 17 points, leading Zach's team to a victory against a solid Andrew performance.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - Wolves' leading man picks up a goal and a fine assist to lead Wolves to a 2-0 win against Southampton, and a huge haul of points for Emily's team as a whole. Cunha himself notched 12 of these with a 3 bonus point performance.
- Matt: Andre Onana - As the second goalkeeper on the list this week, Onana also picked up 9 points off the back of his clean sheet. The only improvement over Leno is that he had 5 saves instead of 4, so basically Onana's better.

In terms of November Manager of the Month, at this halfway point we see just 4 undefeated teams! Led by Emily's 90 PF, Kevin, Zach, and Rebecca all sit narrowly behind as there is still plenty of month to go!

<br/>

Over on the form table, we somehow have a tie for 1st? Gavin and I each have 12/15 points and 192 PF over the past 5 weeks, which is cool. MatthewR and Rebecca have been on the same pace with 12/15 earned points (but have a few less PF).

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by two top 6 matchups: the first Matt(hew) derby between me and Matt and Jesse vs Luke. Elsewhere, we have a couple of good midtable clashes in Coop vs Kevin and Darryan vs Gavin.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (6) vs Matt (2)
- Jesse (3) vs Luke (5)
- Emily (14) vs Zach (8)
- Andrew (16) vs Dylan (4)
- Soph (15) vs MatthewR (1)
- Coop (13) vs Kevin (11)
- Scott (12) vs Rebecca (7)
- Darryan (10) vs Gavin (9)

Shoutout this week to Rebecca for picking up her 4th win in a row and Kevin for 4 undefeated (3W1D)! We also see Dylan with 3 undefeated (2W1D) and Zach and Emily with back-to-back wins each.
