<br/>

This week sees more movement across the table, with Kevin taking up a 2 point lead over Matt, who moves up to 3rd over Luke by 2 points. 4th goes out of reach for me, as I sit 8 points back. Gavin still has a chance to pass me with 2 weeks left, as he moves to 4 points back. Further down, Darryan puts himself with an off chance of taking 8th as his gap to Rebecca decreases to 4 points as well. Key wins this week from Scott and Dylan move them further up the table to 10th and 11th, pushing Jesse to 12th on PF. Coop also moves toward the top of the relegation zone with his win, now just 2 points from safety.

Now onto the Game Changers! Just 2 more points on this list compared to last week!

- Dylan: Jarrod Bowen - Bowen picked up the second goal in West Ham's 2-0 win against Manchester United this week, securing 8 points for Dylan and 3 for the Hammers.
- MatthewR: Sandro Tonali - The Italian midfielder grabbed his 4th goal of the season in this week's 2-0 win against Chelsea, enough for 3 bonus points and 11 total for MatthewR.
- Kevin: Morgan Gibbs-White - A huge week for the Nottingham Forest man with a hyphenated name as MGW grabbed a goal, well worked assist, and 3 bonus points as Nottingham Forest could only come away with a draw against Leicester.
- Matt: Aaron Ramsdale - Another huge week for Onana to be benched, as the Southampton goalkeeper cursed them to relegation, but not to a loss against Manchester City, picking up a clean sheet, 4 saves, and all 3 bonus points (for 10 total) in their 0-0 draw.
- Gavin: Michael Keane - The should-be-Everton-striker scored a fine header from center back in Everton's 3-1 win against Fulham, earning him a bonus point and a 9 point return for Gavin.
- Darryan: Raul Jimenez - Darryan's team was led by the man on the other side of the field, as Jimenez was able to pick up Fulham's lone goal and (because he's a FWD), all 3 bonus points in their defeat, for 9 points for Darryan.
- Scott: Aaron Wan-Bissaka - Back to back appearances on this list for AWB as this week he picked up an assist, clean sheet, and all 3 bonus points for a huge 12 points.
- Coop: Chris Wood - The Kiwi is back on the list, scoring the other goal for Nottingham Forest in their draw and picking up 2 bonus points as well. That put him at 20 goals on the season and 8 points this week.

Halfway through May and the Manager of the Month race is led by Kevin on PF! Dylan, Scott, Darryan, and Gavin remain as the only undefeated teams!

In terms of the form table, Kevin and Darryan sit on top with 15/15 points earned! Luke and Scott are the lone two managers just behind with 4 wins in 5.

<br/>

- Coop picked up a big win this week to stay within reaching difference of Jesse and Dylan, who combined will play all of the top 4 in the last 2 weeks
- Soph needs to win out and for Coop and Emily to lose out to stay out of the relegation zone

Shoutout this week to Kevin for a 7 winstreak! Darryan is next with 5 wins in a row, Scott for 4 in a row, and Dylan and Gavin for picking up back to back wins!
