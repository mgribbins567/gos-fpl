Happy gameweek 9! Welcome back from the October international break! I hope you didn't have to deal with your 1st round pick getting injured over the past couple of weeks (thanks England). Anyway, this week saw some great matches including 2 draws! A 23-all tie between Jesse and Kevin, and a 25-all draw between Soph and Darryan, taking Darryan up to 2(!!) draws already. Other notable results this week included Coop's 46-33 upset over Scott and MatthewR taking the Matt(hew) derby 31-21.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 40-29 Zach
- Luke 43-30 Dylan
- Matt 21-31 MatthewR
- Jesse 23-23 Kevin
- Emily 18-36 Rebecca
- Andrew 9-42 Gavin
- Soph 25-25 Darryan
- Coop 46-33 Scott

This week sees a number of changes across the table, mostly 4th and below, as MatthewR uses his win against Matt to cement a 5 point lead at the top. Jesse's draw also takes him level on points with Matt as they sit 4 points ahead of Luke, who leapfrogged Darryan this week due to his draw. Coop and I also join the group on 12 points and within striking distance of the top 4. Gavin also uses this week to take a very narrow points for lead to exit the relegation zone for the first time since Gameweek 1.

Next up, the Game Changers! This low scoring week contains just 3 players on this list with 10+ points and a bunch of the usual names!

- Matthew: Iliman Ndiaye - Somehow my 14th round pick has cemented his name on this list twice (out of 4 possible), with a 9 point performance off the back of a goal and 3 bonus points against Ipswich.
- Luke: Alejandro Garnacho - As the trade for McNeil turns in Luke's favor this week, Garnacho picked up a well worked goal and 3 bonus points to lead Luke's team with 10 points.
- MatthewR: Nicolas Jackson - Jackson picks up his 5th goal of the season in Chelsea's loss to Liverpool to provide MatthewR with a key 6 pointer and victory over Matt.
- Jesse: Jamie Vardy - The Vardy party continues across the aisle this time, picking up a goal and bonus point en route to a Jesse tie. On Kevin's side, a 5 pointer off an assist for Udogie led his team to the tie.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - The highest (owned) scorer of the week, Mo Salah continues his reign as he picks up a goal, assist, and 2 bonus points for a 12 point haul.
- Gavin: Josko Gvardiol - As Gvardiol picks up yet another beautiful weak foot goal and 10 points for Gavin, he continues to pose the question: is he a better striker than Haaland?
- Soph: Ollie Watkins - Watkins continues his form this week picking up a goal and 2 bonus in Villa's win (for 8 points), leading Soph to a draw against Darryan. On Darryan's side, Emi Martinez's clean sheet and 3 saves put up an equalizing 8 pointer.
- Coop: Dejan Kulusevski - In back-to-back appearances as the Game Changer for Coop's team, a goal and 2 bonus points against West Ham (and 9 points against Scott) did nicely. Son losing an assist and handing a bonus point over to Kulu also helped.

In terms of October Manager of the Month, I take the lead heading into the final week of the month! I sit with just a 6 points for lead over Gavin, and 13 ahead of MatthewR.

Looking at the form table we once again see MatthewR at the top with 15/15 points, just ahead of Darryan on 11 and a huge group on 10 and 9 points.

Next week will see some great matchups! This week is highlighted by Luke vs Matt and Me vs Darryan in what should be a great couple of top-half matches. Other interesting matchups include midtable matchups between Rebecca and Coop along with Gavin vs Scott.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Darryan vs Matthew
- Gavin vs Scott
- Rebecca vs Coop
- Kevin vs Soph
- MatthewR vs Andrew
- Dylan vs Emily
- Zach vs Jesse
- Luke vs Matt

Shoutout this week to our sole 8 winstreak: MatthewR! Other shoutouts go to Darryan, who has an undefeated streak of 5 with 2 draws in it, which makes it particularly impressive. Other shoutouts go to myself and Gavin for picking up 2 back-to-back wins!
