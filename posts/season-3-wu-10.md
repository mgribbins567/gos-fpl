This week sees a number of changes across the table, with the race for 4th starting to heat up! MatthewR still sits atop the table with a 5 point lead over Matt and Jesse, who now sit 7 points ahead of 4th. In that race currently includes Luke, me, Dylan, and Darryan, all sitting on either 15 or 14 points (Darryan). Just behind, Gavin gains some ground on this group moving up to 8th with his win and Rebecca up to 10th to join Coop on 12 points. Kevin's win slides him slightly up the table to 14th.

Now onto the Game Changers! Slowly increasing the number of 10+ pointers on this list with 4 this week (up from 3 last week)!

- Matthew: Bukayo Saka - Saka picks up his 2nd spot on this list for me in the past 3 weeks! This week was well deserved as he cooked my own defender (Robertson) en route to 9 points off the back of a goal and 2 bonus points.
- Gavin: Josko Gvardiol - Back-to-back wins for Gavin and back-to-back man of the matches for Gvardiol! This week he picked up a clean sheet and 3 bonus for a 9 pointer during Manchester City's 1-0 win over Southampton.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - Yet another double digit (10 point) return for Salah from a goal and 3 bonus proving to be the difference maker for Rebecca this week. This is his 6th week this season with 10+.
- Kevin: Alex Iwobi - As everyone expected, Alex Iwobi would be the second highest point scorer this week, with 11 points off the back of a nicely worked goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus points.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - With his 3rd appearance on this list, Cole Palmer yet again leads MatthewR's team to victory with 10 points from a goal and 3 bonus. Unfortunately, he didn't get any points for the hockey assist that led to Chelsea's first goal.
- Dylan: Dean Henderson - In what was probably the biggest upset this weekend, Crystal Palace's 1-0 win over Spurs guaranteed a clean sheet, 3 saves, and a bonus point for Dean Henderson and netted Dylan 8 points.
- Jesse: Jamie Vardy - Picking up his second appearance on this list in a row, Vardy led Jesse's surprisingly empty team to victory with 8 points from a goal and 2 bonus.
- Matt: Bryan Mbeumo - As Haaland's pace begins to slow, old man Bryan Mbeumo begins to emerge as a golden boot container as he scored twice and picked up 3 bonus to provide Matt a very nice 15 pointer this week.

In terms of October Manager of the Month, we have our first ever tie! Me and MatthewR sit tied on top of the table with 9 points earned and 125 Points For so we will share the title! Also, shoutout to Gavin who picked up 9/9 points and narrowly missed out on the 3-way tie with only 121 Points For this month.

Looking at the form table we once again see MatthewR at the top with 15/15 points as his winning streak continues. Matt, me, and Gavin sit just behind on 12/15 points gained in the last 5. Looking ahead to November we see a full suite of 4 gameweeks, so good luck!
