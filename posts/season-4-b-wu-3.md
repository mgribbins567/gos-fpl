And, one more announcement! <u>[gosfpl.com/season-4](https://www.gosfpl.com/season-4)</u> has been updated to have _live updates_ for matchup scores for **both** leagues! This means, if you want, you can solely use the poorly performing app/website for setting your lineup and making waivers, and use this site for all your score checking needs! This is a work in progress (and I hate working on UI stuff), so suggestions and patience welcome as I continue adding things! Also, we're back in mid-season form of these being written/sent out in the middle of the night so that's awesome.

Hello everyone and welcome to gameweek 3! Waivers this week are due on Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT as the games start on Saturday! This week saw some interesting matches, headlined by Divya's narrow victory over Andrew, 41-38. Elsewhere, Chris pulls off a huge 45-31 win over me and Alex fends off a Travis 43 pointer with 60 points of his own. Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 31-45 Chris
- John 32-47 ZachA
- Mack 41-19 Emma
- Alex 60-43 Travis
- Cara 38-26 Morgs
- Andrew 38-41 Divya

<br/>

These results see just 3 undefeated teams remain, led by Zach! Chris sits just 6 PF behind and Cara another 17.

Now onto the game changers!

- Chris: Moises Caicedo - 8 pts - Apparently the watch party worked? At least enough for him to get a goal.
- ZachA: Joao Pedro - 15 pts - Something about Chelsea players on Zach's team just unleashes something. He did leap like a fish for his goal though.
- Mack: Viktor Gyokeres - 12 pts - A beautiful display of fixing his hair after scoring a brace.
- Alex: Jordan Pickford - 15 pts - Yeah, his water bottle said 50% left 50% right yet he saved it anyway.
- Cara: Cody Gakpo - 10 pts - Lots of double assist players this week. Fortunately for Cara his 2 bonus canceled out the -2 from Gordon.
- Divya: Josh Cullen - 14 pts - You don't often see a Cullen out during the day, let alone scoring and assisting in a soccer match.

In terms of our first week of 3 in the August Manager of the Month race, the table matches the table above, so not much to say there. ZachA pulls ahead slightly on PF!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by two undefeated teams in ZachA vs Cara. Elsewhere, two more of our high scorers will face off as Chris takes on Alex. Should be a good week of matchups! Full matchups are as follows:

- Morgs vs Matthew
- Travis vs Divya
- Emma vs Andrew
- ZachA vs Cara
- Chris vs Alex
- John vs Mack

And lastly, shoutouts! Shoutout to Zach, Chris, and Cara for their 2 winstreaks!

# Power Rankings

On the bubble (in no order): Andrew, Travis, Cara, Kevin, Dylan
Fell off: Cara, Jesse

10 - Alex (NEW) - League B - Alex's 60 point showing (highest score from both leagues) this week forced my hand to sneak him in at #10. That said, the score was off the back of a rare Pickford pen save, 2 assists from Calafiori, and a Gravenberch goal, so while the score was solid, I want to see some more consistency before he moves higher.

9 - Chris (-) - League B - Another 40+ pointer from Chris cemented his spot in the top 10 this week, and that's with his 1st rounder picking up yet another 2 pointer and leaving 8 on the bench with Tarkowski.

8 - MatthewR (NEW) - League A - Back to back 40+ point weeks and some defcon monsters, plus leaving points on the bench. Some defensive contribution monsters on this team and has a lot of potential if Enzo and Tavernier can keep producing (and Watkins wakes up). Fortunately for him, Odegaard's injury isn't bad either.

7 - Mack (-1) - League B - The drop isn't even necessarily for her team doing worse, but other teams doing better. A second 40+ point for Mack (with Dango sitting quietly on the bench and Eze waiting for his Arsenal debut) puts her firmly in the top 10 in my eyes. Gyokeres's spot is also nailed for the time being, along with Barnes even if a new striker starts playing (shoutout Anthony Gordon).

6 - Zach (-4) - League A - Rough week for Zach as Saka goes down with a hamstring injury and Gvardiol remains out for who knows how long. Beto also appeared from the bench, while MLS finds himself behind the luscious locks of the Italian Arsenal left back. Still think this team has a lot of potential, but it will rely on some Rogers magic and Ekitike to keep form.

5 - ZachA (+3) - League B - For the other Zach however, things are looking up. Joao Pedro showed up against West Ham, somehow both of his Chelsea defenders contributed to goals, and Sarr picks up his first goal of the season. Until ZachA averages _less_ than 47.5 points per week I think I'm obligated to put him here.

4 - Matthew (-1) - League A - Moving myself down a place due to the head to head loss against Luke. Still waiting on my FWDs to do something, though.

3 - Luke (+2) - League A - Moved up due to the head to head win against me. Gakpo, Ndiaye, and the Bournemouth defense carrying despite the short term injuries to Palmer and Georginio, but his FWD situation continues to look dire.

2 - Darryan (+2) - League A - A huge week from Darryan's team as his defenders put up 6/24/13/6. The rest of his team didn't do anything but 57 points is 57 points. On one hand, he has quite the weak midfield, on the other, midfielders are aplenty. And if his defenders and Haaland continue as they are, he'll be fine.

1 - Matthew2 (-) - League B - Definitely an off weak for this team with so many attacking players blanking, but I do still think it's the best option to put here _for the moment_. Another off week and it is banished though.

Also, there is a sense of momentum with these rankings i.e. it will take some time for managers to rise and fall, just because I've looked at these teams a lot and have my own personal opinions and predictions of how players will perform in the future. I also tend to not give up on players super easily, especially if they've shown that they can come up with points consistently.

And that's about it for this week! Good luck out there!
