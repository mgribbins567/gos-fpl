Happy gameweek 13! This week has a quick turnaround due to the Friday game, so waivers are due on Thursday at 10:30 PST / 1:30 EST! This week saw a couple of interesting results across the table, including my 39-33 upset of Matt, Emily's huge 55-24 win over Zach, Luke and Jesse both having a rough week giving Luke an important 26-17 win, and Coop's narrow 33-27 win against Kevin.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 39-33 Matt
- Jesse 17-26 Luke
- Emily 55-24 Zach
- Andrew 9-41 Dylan
- Soph 33-59 MatthewR
- Coop 33-27 Kevin
- Scott 31-45 Rebecca
- Darryan 32-42 Gavin

This week sees the top 7 places remain unchanged, but the gap closes between 2nd and 7th to just 4 points. Yet still, MatthewR sits now 8 points ahead of Matt in 2nd. Jesse is just 2 points behind him, with Dylan another 1 point behind Jesse, and Luke, myself, and Rebecca all just 1 point behind him. Joining the top half this week is Gavin, who sits on 18 points. Meanwhile, Coop and Emily join Zach on 15 points, jumping ahead of Darryan, Kevin, and Scott this week.

Now onto the Game Changers with another interesting set of players and scores!

- Matthew: Bukayo Saka - With yet another solid performance from Saka, this is his 3rd time on this list! Against Nottingham Forest he provided a goal, assist, clean sheet, and 3 bonus for a 13 point haul.
- Luke: Adam Armstrong - Adam Armstrong had an... interesting week this week, filling the positive point category with a goal, (very nice) assist, and one bonus point, and the negative point column with a penalty miss and yellow card. Tally all of those up and his 7 points lead Luke's team.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - With a 2nd straight double digit haul, Cunha's very good season continues as he puts together a 2 goal, 1 assist performance to pick up 3 bonus points and 16 total points for Emily this week.
- Dylan: Jarrod Bowen - Bowen's first appearance on this list this season comes off the back of West Ham's 2-0 win at Newcastle in which he contributed a goal. That plus a bonus and clean sheet point led Dylan's team with 7 points.
- MatthewR: Nicolas Jackson - Jackson marks his own 3rd appearance on this list with a 12 point performance from a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points. A very tidy finish and half of a striker partnership for MatthewR that scored a total of 24 points.
- Coop: Guglielmo Vicario - In a great Spurs performance this weekend that Coop surely enjoyed, Vicario picked up a clean sheet, 5 saves, 1 bonus point, and a broken ankle en route to their 4-0 win at Manchester City and 8 points in fantasy.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - Who could have guessed? Another Rebecca win and another Salah game changer, his 5th of the season! That's 42% of gameweeks this season with Salah on this list and 5/7 (71%) of Rebecca's wins. This week he scored 13 points from 2 goals and 2 bonus points.
- Gavin: James Maddison - Maddison's insane performance against Manchester City led both Spurs and Gavin to their respective victories. With a gameweek high tie with Cunha at 16 points, Maddison picked up 2 goals, a clean sheet, and 3 bonus.

In terms of November Manager of the Month, we are down to just 2 undefeated teams: Emily and Rebecca! Emily currently has a 28 point PF lead, so with a win over Jesse she will have the upper hand. Should both lose, Dylan sits 2 points behind and can leapfrog each outright with a win.

In terms of the form table, Rebecca has achieved a perfect 15/15 points over the past 5 weeks! Just behind her sit Gavin, MatthewR, and myself with 12/15 possible points picked up.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a matchup in the (current) race for 2nd between me and Rebecca! Elsewhere, we will see Zach take on Coop, Jesse take on in-form Emily, and Kevin look to bounce back with a win against Gavin.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Rebecca (7) vs Matthew (6)
- Kevin (13) vs Gavin (8)
- MatthewR (1) vs Darryan (12)
- Dylan (4) vs Scott (13)
- Zach (9) vs Coop (10)
- Luke (5) vs Soph (15)
- Matt (2) vs Andrew (16)
- Jesse (3) vs Emily (11)

Shoutout this week to Rebecca for 5 in a row! Also shoutout to Dylan who has picked up 4 unbeaten (3W1D), Emily's 3 wins in a row. Me and MatthewR are both on 2 winstreaks as well.
