Happy gameweek 32! Waivers this week are due at the usual time of Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This week saw some nail-biters, including Luke's come from behind 44-40 win over Darryan, Kevin's narrow upset against MatthewR 28-27, and a match for the sickos where Jesse defeated Coop 19-18.

Full results are as follows:

- Andrew 19-39 Matthew
- Soph 38-18 Emily
- Coop 18-19 Jesse
- Scott 34-40 Matt
- Darryan 40-44 Luke
- Gavin 51-31 Zach
- Rebecca 37-30 Dylan
- Kevin 28-27 MatthewR

<br/>

This week sees even less movement around the table, with just 1 position change! That said, MatthewR's lead in 1st has dropped down to just 11 points (:eyes:) - will Matt capitalize? Or will MatthewR simply win 3 matches to secure the title? Anyway, status quo until 5th (read last week's update if you want a reminder on what the gaps are), but Zach's loss takes him 4 points behind me in 5th. Just below him, Gavin's win takes him just 3 points off top 6 with Rebecca keeping similar pace in 8th. Our one movement on the board sees Jesse climb to 9th over Coop, with a possibly insurmountable 7 points between him and the top half. The only other win in the bottom half saw Soph move to just 1 point behind Season 1 winner Darryan, who remains in the relegation zone.

Now onto the Game Changers! One of the lowest scoring weeks this season, but a number of regulars have made it.

- Matthew: Iliman Ndiaye - The Senegalese international is back! In his first start post-injury, he scored a contentiously-earned penalty to lead Everton to a 1-1 draw against Arsenal and find himself with 3 bonus points, for yet another 9 pointer.
- Soph: Jacob Murphy - What a day for Jacob Murphy, as he led Newcastle to a 3-0 win against just a truly awful Leicester side. He himself picked up a brace and clean sheet point to earn 3 bonus and a very solid 16 pointer for Soph. Also, Leicester subbed on a player who was _too young_ to wear a kit with their betting sponsor on the front. So that was cool.
- Jesse: Youri Tielemans - Did not take much for either manager to take home a win in this matchup, so the Belgian's 6 points from an assist and single bonus point was enough. It was a pretty good assist too for Morgan Rogers' goal in Villa's 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest.
- Matt: Andre Onana - Honestly, this game was so incredibly boring I went on a run instead of finishing it, so I'm not surprised Onana ended up with 11 points in their 0-0 Manchester derby. A nice send off to De Bruyne I guess?
- Luke: Fabian Schar - Just go watch Murphy's second goal. I'm not sure what exactly was going through his mind when he decided to shoot from behind the midfield line, but it sure worked out as it earned him an (FPL) assist and bonus point in what was a needed 10 points for Luke.
- Gavin: Tino Livramento - Playing on his lesser-favored side, the young Englishman had an impressive performance and weak footed assist to pick up 2 bonus and one-up the previous Newcastle defender with 11 points.
- Rebecca: Mark Flekken - I think they call this recreating Salah in the aggregate? As the Brentford keeper was involved in a different 0-0 game (this one against Chelsea), he picked up a clean sheet, 6 saves, and 2 bonus points for a 10 pointer on the week.
- Kevin: Alex Iwobi - Iwobi picked up his 4th double digit week with a goal and assist in Fulham's huge 3-2 win against Liverpool this week, taking home 13 whole points for Kevin's team.

As for April manager of the month, I'm off to a substantial lead! Just 1 PF separates me and Luke, with Gavin 2 points behind him. Matt and Kevin also sit unbeaten (with slightly less PF, though). Tons of April left to go though!

In terms of the form table, Luke has picked up a flawless 15/15 points! Myself and Gavin sit just behind him with 12/15 points earned.

Next week sees some great matchups, headlined by a battle in the top 4 race between myself and Kevin! Elsewhere, a couple of matchups that could be really close or really not close in MatthewR vs Rebecca and Zach vs Darryan, along with a couple of key bottom half pairings including matches of Jesse vs Soph Emily vs Andrew.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (5) vs Kevin (3)
- MatthewR (1) vs Rebecca (8)
- Dylan (11) vs Gavin (7)
- Zach (6) vs Darryan (14)
- Luke (4) vs Scott (13)
- Matt (2) vs Coop (10)
- Jesse (9) vs Soph (15)
- Emily (12) vs Andrew (16)

# The Run In

And to close out the season, I thought instead of this being a one-off blog, why not create a new section to keep track of our Top 4 and relegation races? The lines had to be (unfortunately) pretty arbitrarily drawn for who is included, so I'll definitely update as managers come and go.

### The Race for Top 4

<br />
<p class="center-bold">Top 4 Table</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/32/top-4-table.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br/>

Some things to note:

- All managers have fairly similar strength of schedules, with Gavin having the easiest remaining matchups (and in being in good form it felt reasonable to include him on this list)
- Dylan plays all 6 managers, MatthewR and Kevin both feature 4 times
- Key 6 pointers this week: Me vs Kevin

<br />
<p class="center-bold">Relegation Table</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/32/relegation-table.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br/>

Notes:

- Interestingly, on average the managers fighting relegation have easier schedules
- Except for Dylan, who has been cursed
- Coop, who is yet to play me and Matt, also faces off against the managers placed 12th-16th and therefore has the easiest remaining schedule
- Historically, ~40 points should be enough for safety
- Key 6 pointers this week: Jesse vs Soph

Shoutout this week to Luke for 5 wins in a row! Also shoutouts to Matt for 4 undefeated (3W1D), my 3 winstreak, and to Gavin and Kevin for picking up back to back wins!
