Hello all and welcome to the final matchday of the Euros! I made a slight mistake last week (oops) so this is actually the final week! This week saw an exciting Spain side led by the 16 year old Yamine Lamal scoring an absolute screamer against France, Xavi Simons taking an early lead against England with his own shot from outside of the box before my guy Ollie Watkins came up with a late winner (!!!). Here's the bracket!

**Finals**

- Spain vs England

This looks to be a great matchup between a side that's good on paper and a side that's been brilliant throughout the tournament.

In terms of our league, Zach retains the lead after faultering slightly this week. He now sits at a total of 342 points after a 31 point performance this matchweek, keeping a distance of 11 points above myself on 331. I had a league-high 43 points off the back of a 10 pointer from captain Mbappe, 8 points from 'arry Kane, and 7 points off the back of the flip-flop goal from Dani Olmo. Further down, MatthewR holds onto his spot in 3rd, with Luke sitting just 5 points behind after his 41 pointer.

| 10       | Emily    | 212    | 43  | 30  | 33  | 48  | 44  | 14  |

Good luck and I hope you enjoy the final match!
