Happy gameweek 18 and happy holidays! (Or Festive Fixtures as NBC calls them). Waivers this week are due at 3am PST / 6am EST on Wednesday due to the slate of games on Boxing Day! This week saw our second highest scoring week of the season with tons of 40+ scores! Most notably was Kevin's second straight 52 point performance against me (who scored 43 this time rather than 36). Elsewhere, Gavin upset Dylan 40-32, Soph took a 53-37 win against Jesse, and MatthewR survived Salah-led Rebecca 45-37.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 43-52 Kevin
- MatthewR 45-37 Rebecca
- Dylan 32-40 Gavin
- Zach 50-28 Darryan
- Luke 47-39 Scott
- Matt 36-18 Coop
- Jesse 37-53 Soph
- Emily 49-11 Andrew

This week sees some pretty widespread changes across the table! Starting at the top, MatthewR keeps his 14 point lead over Matt, who now sits 4 points ahead of Luke and myself in 3rd and 4th. Jesse and Dylan remain 1 and 2 points behind me, respectively, while Zach, Kevin, and Gavin leapfrog Rebecca who falls out of 7th after something like 8 weeks. Further down the table, Emily's win takes her above Darryan by a point, to 12th.

Now onto the Game Changers! In accordance with the average this week, this is also the second highest game changers combined points this season!

- Kevin: Alexander Isak - I think we can safely say that Kevin won the Isak for Vardy trade.. This week he put up a hat trick against Ipswich (and could have had a number more) for 3 bonus and 17 total points.
- MatthewR: Dominik Szoboszlai - MatthewR was bailed out this week as Szoboszlai picks up only his 4th gameweek return this season with a goal and 3 assists for 2 bonus points as Liverpool put 6 into the net against Spurs. 17 points was enough to stem the bleeding from the Salah 21 pointer he was up against.
- Gavin: Bruno Guimaraes - With his 2nd 7 pointer in 2, Bruno G's more advanced position seems to be working as he picked up an assist, cs point, and bonus point for Gavin this week.
- Zach: Declan Rice - In his 32 minute cameo against Crystal Palace, Rice grabbed an assist to Martinelli and a great finish en route to 2 bonus points and 11 total points.
- Luke: Morgan Rogers - During Villa's upset over City this weekend, Rogers led the team to a well worked Duran goal (providing the assist) along with a nice finish himself to send Villa up 2-0. He was then subbed before City's goal, banking the cs and taking his total to 14 points this week.
- Matt: Luis Diaz - Unsurprisingly, another Liverpool attacker makes the list as Luis Diaz's flying header and other goal I can't remember provided 13 points for Matt's team this week.
- Soph: Gabriel Jesus - For some reason, Gabriel Jesus hates Crystal Palace as he put up 5 goals in 4 days against them, with 2 this game (+ an assist and 3 bonus points), to score 16 points and lead Soph to a big upset this week.
- Emily: Matt Doherty - Bouncing back from an own goal last week with a clean sheet, assist, and bonus point this week, Doherty led Emily's team to victory with 10 points.


2 more weeks to go and MatthewR retains his spot as the only undefeated team in December! Managers just behind on 3 wins include Kevin, Matt, Luke, and Zach.

In terms of the form table, MatthewR remains at the top with 15/15 points earned! Kevin and Zach sit with 12/15 points earned across the past 5.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by two of the teams mentioned above: Kevin vs Zach! Elsewhere, Gavin takes on Matt, Luke hopes for Salah to slow down in his match vs Rebecca, and MatthewR takes on top 4 hopeful Dylan.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Soph (14) vs Matthew (4)
- Coop (11) vs Andrew (16)
- Scott (15) vs Emily (12)
- Darryan (13) vs Jesse (5)
- Gavin (9) vs Matt (2)
- Rebecca (10) vs Luke (3)
- Kevin (8) vs Zach (7)
- MatthewR (1) vs Dylan (6)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 7 winstreak! Also shoutout to Gavin and Soph for their 2 winstreaks!
