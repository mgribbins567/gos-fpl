Hello everybody and welcome to the Short n' Sweet cup! I'd like to start by issuing a formal apology for the announcement. It's perhaps one of the worst paragraphs I've sent to this group and nearly illegible in parts, but hey, I fit in all the song titles :)

That said, the groups and group stage matchups have been generated! Due to all of the movement in the table, the groups got shuffled quite a bit since the last week, so let's take a look at them!

**Group A**

- MatthewR
- Zach
- Gavin
- Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt
- Rebecca
- Emily
- Scott

**Group C**

- Dylan
- Luke
- Kevin
- Soph

**Group D**

- Matthew
- Jesse
- Coop
- Darryan

There's definitely some tough groups here, so good luck and every point matters considering the bottom of the group after 3 gameweeks is **out**.

And onto the matchups! These have been generated the same way as usual (1v4, 2v3 -> 1v3, 2v4 -> 1v2, 3v4) and then shuffled manually so that there are no double gameweeks for anyone. That means we will see the following matchups this week:

**Group A**

- MatthewR vs Andrew
- Zach vs Gavin

**Group B**

- Matt vs Scott
- Rebecca vs Emily

**Group C**

- Dylan vs Soph
- Luke vs Kevin

**Group D**

- Matthew vs Darryan
- Jesse vs Coop

And here's the image with all of the colors!
