Happy gameweek 5! This week waiver's are due Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT so get them in! This week had some great matchups, including the first draw of the season (and almost 2 more!), so let's get into it. Starting with high flying Matt, whose winning streak has been broken by Darryan in a 40-all draw. Other close matchups include Luke's narrow 36-35 victory over Gavin, who is still searching for his first win of the season, and Coop's 23-22 win over Emily. Soph put up the highest score of the week with an impressive 61 points to pick up 3 points off of Andrew, who scored 19.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 33-39 MatthewR
- Dylan 48-27 Kevin
- Zach 24-32 Rebecca
- Luke 36-35 Gavin
- Matt 40-40 Darryan
- Jesse 38-34 Scott
- Emily 22-23 Coop
- Andrew 19-61 Soph

This week sees a bit of a gap growing at the top, as Matt draws and MatthewR and Jesse continue their winning ways and sit at an impressive 12/12 points earned. Luke sits just behind Matt, being the only manager on 9 points, and a whole host of managers sit on 6. Gavin remains the only winless manager (albeit he and I occupy the bottom 2 spots of the luck table :copium:).

Next up, the Game Changers! This week saw a return of players in the teens, as the weekly average rebounds slightly.

- MatthewR: Matthis de Ligt - A solid last minute pickup for MatthewR, a center back with a goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus to arrive at 15 points was definitely enough to carry his struggling midfield this week.
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalh√£es - With the exact same scoring week as De Ligt, not much to say about Gabriel other than what a performance. For Arsenal and for Dylan.
- Rebecca: Wesley Fofana - As one of 3 players on Rebecca's team to score 7 points, Fofana put in a solid performance picking up one of the record number of yellows that game, a clean sheet, and an impressive 2 bonus points.
- Luke: David Raya - Solid performance for Raya against Spurs, garnering 9 total points off the back of a clean sheet, 5 saves, and 2 bonus. Solid performance and was _just_ enough to give Luke the win this week.
- Matt: Erling Haaland - 3rd week in a row. Cool. He's just automatic- 2 goals, 3 bonus, 13 points. (Also, shoutout Diogo Dalot for his 11 pointer from an assist, clean sheet, and 2 bonus points for Darryan, who Matt drew with this week)
- Jesse: Arijanet Muric - Ipswich (and Jesse) fans rejoice as Muric puts in an actually good performance in their 0-0 draw against Brighton, earning him 11 points off the back of a clean sheet, 6 saves, and the full 3 bonus points.
- Coop: Marc Cucurella - Fun to have Cucurella and Haaland both here! Cucurella's song resonated as his 5 pointer (he also got a yellow in that fateful match) from the clean sheet led Coop's team to their win this week.
- Soph: Robert Sanchez - In probably the longest point breakdown we'll see this season, Sanchez's self-caused 15 pointer led Soph's incredible week. He earned a clean sheet, penalty save, yellow card (obviously), 7 saves, and 3 bonus points.

Onto the month of September and a new Manager of the Month award! Soph has started this short, 3 gameweek month with an early lead, followed by Dylan, MatthewR, and Jesse.

Form table still on pause ( two. more. weeks. ) :)

Next week should see some great matchups, headlined by MatthewR vs Luke! Other notable matchups will see Jesse try to defend his unbeaten run in a pairing against Rebecca, Soph hoping to continue the good week with another one against Scott, and maybe I'll be able to pick up some points in a bottom half matchup against Coop. Full matchups are:

- Coop (10) vs Matthew (12)
- Scott (5) vs Soph (8)
- Darryan (11) vs Andrew (14)
- Gavin (16) vs Emily (15)
- Rebecca (7) vs Jesse (2)
- Kevin (13) vs Matt (3)
- MatthewR (1) vs Luke (4)
- Dylan (6) vs Zach (9)

Shoutout this week to our two remaining 4 winstreaks: MatthewR and Jesse! Elsewhere, Matt has picked up his 4th unbeaten match with the draw against Darryan, and Luke and Coop have picked up 2 wins on the bounce! Also, shoutout Soph for the 60+ week!
