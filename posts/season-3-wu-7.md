Happy gameweek 7! This week's waivers are due Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT! This week saw some great matchups (albeit little table movement), so let's jump right in! This week saw 3 matchups end within 3 points: Dylan took a narrow 30-27 win against me, Matt kept his undefeated dreams alive with a 31-29 win over Rebecca, and Coop picked up 3 points off Soph with their 32-30 victory. Elsewhere, MatthewR put up a week-high 56 points to Zach's 29.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 27-30 Dylan
- Zach 29-56 MatthewR
- Luke 47-34 Kevin
- Matt 31-29 Rebecca
- Jesse 46-26 Gavin
- Emily 21-31 Darryan
- Andrew 19-47 Scott
- Soph 30-32 Coop

This week sees about the same as last week, as MatthewR and Jesse continue with 18/18 possible points and Matt just 2 points behind. Luke and Dylan remain just 4 points off 3rd, and a whole host are in the 10-6 range.

Next up, the Game Changers! A good variety this week as we see many games come down to dubious bonus point numbers and various good performances from players!

- Dylan: Evanilson - And with this, Dylan's poor first week has paid off. Evanilson picked up a well placed goal and 3 bonus points en route to a 9 pointer and his first return of the season.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - As Cole Palmer only seems to get better this season, he picks up 4 goals in the first half and (of course) 3 bonus points for a grand total of 25 points. That's just 8 points off of this week's average!
- Luke: Liam Delap - This ex-Man City youngster picked up a brace for Ipswich on their way to a quite impressive 2-2 draw against Aston Villa and 12 points for Luke as he swept past Kevin.
- Matt: Bryan Mbeumo - One of the 3 regulars from Matt's team shows again, as Matt relied on Mbeumo's goal and (more importantly) his 2 bonus points take him to a total of 9 and push Matt to narrowly defeat Rebecca this week.
- Jesse: Dwight McNeil - McNeil has become a real focal point for Everton these past few weeks as he picks up his second double digit haul in the last 3 weeks. That is off the back of 2 goals (a worldie at that) and 3 bonus for a 15 pointer.
- Darryan: Van de Ven - Micky found himself on a 40 yard run into the Game Changers box as he showed his speed in assisting the Brennan Johnson goal for Spurs in their 3-0 win against United. This 11 pointer also propelled Darryan to his win!
- Scott: Gabriel Martinelli - As Scott's tactic of taking as many Arsenal left wingers continues working, Martinelli grabbed a goal, assist, and 3 bonus this week for 13 points and a solid Scott win.
- Coop: Dejan Kulusevski - Coop will happily see this name on the list as Dejan contributed an incredible performance at the 8 and picked up a classic Swede goal and 3 bonus for the Tottenham fan's 11 pointer and win in the league.

Huge congratulations to MatthewR for picking up the September Manager of the Month award! Following Coop's victory over Soph, MatthewR took it on points for over Dylan and Jesse who also picked up 9/9 points thanks to aforementioned Cole Palmer.

Looking at the form table for the first time this season, we see, as expected, MatthewR and Jesse with the full 15/15 available points. Matt and Dylan are also in the race with 13 and 12 points gained, respectively.

Next week will see some great matchups, including what will likely be one of MatthewR and Jesse picking up their first loss. Other highlights include a Gribins derby between me and Scott, a top 5 matchup between Dylan and Matt, and what should be an instant classic between Zach and Luke. Full matchups are as follows:

- Scott (7) vs Matthew (10)
- Darryan (6) vs Coop (9)
- Gavin (14) vs Soph (8)
- Rebecca (11) vs Andrew (15)
- Kevin (13) vs Emily (16)
- MatthewR (1) vs Jesse (2)
- Dylan (5) vs Matt (3)
- Zach (12) vs Luke (4)

Shoutout this week to our two remaining 6 winstreaks: MatthewR and Jesse! And Matt for 6 undefeated! This week also sees Dylan pick up a 3 winstreak and Darryan with 3 undefeated.
