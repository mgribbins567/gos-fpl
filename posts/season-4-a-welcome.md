Hello everyone and welcome back! As of today, the league has been created and is joinable at [draft.premierleague.com](https://draft.premierleague.com/) using the league code **CODE**. (The code will be available in the email and Discord message, but not on the website).

I am so excited for this season as we will see full promotion and relegation, multi-league tournaments, and more! Hopefully, this season will be bigger and better than ever!

Tentatively, the draft date has been set to Sunday, August 10th at 11am PDT / 2pm EDT (with the League B draft following it that evening). Here is the draft availability form, please fill it out asap so that I can adjust times as needed! https://forms.gle/brYSGqDZWRSb8eq66

Since none of you are new faces I can skip a lot of the blabbering and get straight into it!

# Managers

Starting with our 3 (and soon to be 4) season wonders, we have:

**Darryan**

Darryan won the Game of Stones Season 1 in dominant fashion, but has yet to find a foothold above 8th in the past 2 seasons - will he be the first 2-time champion?

**Dylan**

Another manager who had a less than ideal Season 3, Dylan hopes to get back on track and replicate his top 4 earning performances from Season 1 and 2.

**Jesse**

After finding himself slipping down the table last season after what some may describe as a disastrous trade, Jesse sets his sights on a repeat of his 4th placed Season 1 performance.

**Kevin**

Slowly but surely, Kevin finds himself inching up the table season by season, finishing 2nd in Season 3 - is this his year to take home gold?

**Matthew**

After a bit of a slump last year in which I found myself in no man's land for much of the season, expectations are surely set fairly high to return to Season 1 and 2 form.

**MatthewR**

As always, the question is: will he defend his title and be the first manager to not only win the league twice, but in back to back years?

**Scott**

Consistent as ever, Scott looks to improve on his midtable finishes over the past 3 years and perhaps even add another trophy to his cabinet.

---

And next up, those who are joining us for their 3rd season!

**Gavin**

Speaking of consistency, Gavin picked up the same amount of points in both Season 2 and 3, so we should expect another 66 point season from him.

**Luke**

With two top 3 finishes (including being the PF champion in Season 3), Luke has to be considered a front runner this season, but can he finally break through and win the title?

**Zach**

Surely, Zach will be looking to advance up the table this season after notching back to back midtable finishes in his first two seasons. Maybe taking a 3rd season Kevin path?

---

And finally, our sophomore managers!

**Coop**

Coop's first season had him flirting with relegation, leaving him with a rather straightforward task for Season 4: survive.

**Matt**

On the other hand, Matt had a _very_ solid season, seeing his 2nd place spot slip away at the very end and finishing in a very respectable 4th. Will he be able to overcome the sophomore slump and keep the Matt(hew) title streak alive?

# Prize Pool

Since y'all have all been here before, you kinda understand the gist of how this prize pool thing works. This season is still _pay what you can_, but **I am requiring contribution**. That means you can give however much or however little as you want, but every manager has to contribute. Last season saw an interesting selection of managers _not_ contribute, so I'd like to maybe not have that happen. And if for whatever reason you don't feel comfortable contributing, reach out to me and we can chat and work something out.

Anyway, my venmo will be added to the email and Discord as usual:

And also I'm contributing $100 (to both leagues) to start the prize pools.

This season's prize pool will be as follows:

- 1st Place
  - Jersey of your choice
  - 50% of prize pool
- 2nd Place
  - 30% of prize pool
- 3rd place
  - 20% of prize pool
- Manager of the Month
  - $10
- Mid-Season Tournaments
  - $30
  - Mystery Kit

# Promotion / Relegation

Lastly, the big change this season is the introduction of full promotion / relegation! That means the **bottom 2** managers in League A at the end of the season will move to League B for Season 5, and be replaced by the **top 2** managers in League B! On top of this, there will also (likely) be a **playoff** between the team that finishes 10th in League A and 3rd in League B to decide if a _third_ team will move to League A! This is still in discussion, but I don't want anyone to be blindsided once I have more details!
