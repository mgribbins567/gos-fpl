Happy gameweek 5 of the kickoff cup! This will be a rather brief update since we just completed the first leg of the Round of 16 and still have a leg to go!

We had a bunch of very close matchups this week, but perhaps the most interesting of them was Matt's 40-38 victory over Jesse. With only a 2 point deficit, Jesse has a great shot of pulling off a huge upset in the Round of 16. Elsewhere we have a number of very narrow leads. Darryan holds just a 4 point lead over Luke (40-36), and both Rebecca vs Kevin (32-27) and Zach vs Andrew (24-19) are at just 5 point deficits. Soph holds the most considerable lead going into the second leg, meaning MatthewR must overcome a 22 point gap in order to not be knocked out as a group winner.

**Left Side**

- Matthew 33-22 Emily
