Happy gameweek 3 of the kickoff cup! With just 1 week left in the group stage, _almost_ every group is up for grabs! Since there are scenarios to discuss, let's go group by group!

# Group A

This group is perhaps the least interesting group after 2 matches. In gameweek 2, Darryan and I picked up wins against Jesse and Soph, respectively, to solidify our positions in the top 2 of the group.

- Matthew 36-27 Jesse
- Darryan 34-18 Soph

This week sees a head-to-head between myself and Darryan for 1st and a head-to-head between Soph and Jesse for 3rd! In the event of a draw, I lead the points for tiebreaker by 7! This could be very impactful, as some other groups are quite close and the advantage for playing a 4-seed over a 3-seed could be huge.

- Matthew vs Darryan
- Jesse vs Soph

# Group B

This interesting group remains in contention, as Gavin took a narrow win over Coop and Kevin and Andrew somehow put up the same scoreline as Andrew and Coop did last week? the hell? scripted?

- Gavin 28-24 Coop
- Kevin 52-20 Andrew

Despite Gavin and Kevin's wins, they (and Andrew) are all in contention for 1st in the group. The following scenarios are needed to clinch 1st place:

- Kevin: Win vs Coop + Gavin Loss vs Andrew or Gavin Win and score +23 (or less) than Kevin
- Gavin: Win vs Andrew + Kevin Loss vs Coop or Kevin Win and score +25 (or more) than Kevin
- Andrew: Win vs Gavin + Kevin Loss or Draw vs Coop

On top of this, Coop can move into 3rd should Andrew lose and Coop score +29 more than Andrew.

- Gavin vs Andrew
- Kevin vs Coop

# Group C

Group C is quite balanced, as Dylan takes a solid win over Rebecca and Scott wins with an even larger point difference over Zach.

- Dylan 60-36 Rebecca
- Scott 58-27 Zach

This group is very firmly led by Scott, who sits atop by 3 points and 25 points for. Dylan and Rebecca sit in similar positions: needing a win to challenge for 1st (or more likely, 2nd), yet not playing each other. Should they each win, Scott, Dylan, and Rebecca would all sit on 6 points, ordered by Points For. If they both lose, Zach would join Dylan and Rebecca on 3 points, ordered similarly, and Scott would win out for 1st place in Group C.

Currently, Zach sits just 19 points for behind Dylan, and with the head-to-head and how this season's matchups have gone, anything is possible in this group. Honestly, I just wrote all of this, but let's do another scenario list:

- Scott: Win vs Rebecca for 1st
- Dylan: Win vs Zach + Scott Loss vs Rebecca AND score +26 (or more) than Scott AND score -8 (or more) than Rebecca for 1st
- Rebecca: Win vs Scott + Dylan Loss vs Zach or Dylan Win vs Zach AND score +10 (or more) than Dylan

Then, if Zach and Scott win, there are like a million scenarios. More than worth typing here tbh.

- Dylan vs Zach
- Scott vs Rebecca

# Group D

Group D sits in the same situation as Group C, but genuinely much more complicated. This week, Luke defeated Emily and MatthewR took a high-scoring victory over Matt.

- Luke 34-22 Emily
- MatthewR 60-45 Matt

Similarly to Scott in Group C, MatthewR sits on 6 points, but unlike Group C, he only has a 5 point Points For lead over Matt in 2nd. That means, should he lose to Luke and Matt defeats Emily, there is a real possibility that Matt takes 1st in the group. Luke as well only sits 20 points behind, so a big win by him can catapult him into 1st (especially if Emily can provide some help).

- Luke vs MatthewR
- Emily vs Matt
