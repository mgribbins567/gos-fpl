Hello all and welcome to gameweek 9 and the second round of the quarter finals! This should be a quick one! Highlights include Zach and MatthewR dueling it out at 32-31 and Kevin barely taking the first leg over Andrew 46-40.

Full Results:

**Top Half**

- Zach 32-31 MatthewR
- Rebecca 31-64 Luke

**Bottom Half**

- Coop 26-41 Darryan
- Andrew 40-46 Kevin

While a couple of these seem perhaps out of reach, the two mentioned above will definitely be ones to keep an eye on!

Consolation Bracket highlights include Gavin's narrow 32-27 first leg win against Jesse and Matt just laying down the hammer with a 62-44 win in the first leg against me.

**Top Half**

- Jesse 27-32 Gavin
- Scott 53-38 Soph

**Bottom Half**

- Dylan 31-46 Emily
- Matt 62-44 Matthew

Jesse vs Gavin is the obvious one to watch here, but with the blanks this week it's possible Soph finds an opportunity to come back against Scott. I think I'm doneso though.
