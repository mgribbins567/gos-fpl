Hello everybody, happy Gameweek 38, and welcome to a very special weekly update! This is being typed on my phone as I travel to Naples by train, so forgive me and I'll do my best to provide the screenshots for these weeks to the website as soon as I can!

Please view the spreadsheet for all of the tables and things that are usually here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQy-Ln_ZJCwgTkUhAVd8kd_8rctbKMSSwlSfGQ4A53I/edit?usp=drivesdk

Waivers this week are due at 6:30am PDT/ 9:30am EDT / 3:30pm CEDT(I think) on Saturday, with the final gameweek occurring concurrently next Sunday! Highlights from this week include Gavin's narrow 31-28 win against Soph, Jesse's 34-28 upset against MatthewR, and Dylan's 22-16 upset over Matt.

Full results are as follows:

- Scott 34-41 Matthew
- Darryan 40-32 Coop
- Gavin 31-28 Soph
- Rebecca 27-21 Andrew
- Kevin 48-22 Emily
- MatthewR 28-34 Jesse
- Dylan 22-16 Matt
- Zach 27-61 Luke

And with that, we see MatthewR sit just 7 points on top of the table, with Kevin securing his spot in 2nd! His lead increases to 4 points ahead of 3rd, now occupied by Luke. Matt drops a spot and is now relying on a Luke loss for any movement. My win this week moves me 7 points behind Matt and 4 ahead of Gavin, meaning I've confirmed 5th this season and likewise Gavin has finished 6th. Zach and Rebecca will be competing for 7th as they are level on points at 54. Darryan has all but secured 9th on PF, while Dylan and Jesse's wins have saved them from relegation and moved them to 10th and 11th! With his loss, Scott drops to 12th with a huge PF advantage and 3 points ahead of Coop in 13th, effectively sealing his fate.

Now onto the game changers! I barely watched any games this week so here's an abbreviated version:

- Matthew: Iliman Ndiaye - 13 - a brace in Everton's last game at Goodison. Tears in my eyes.
- Darryan: Raul Jimenez - 9 - scored a goal and he's a forward in a 3-2 win against Brentford.
- Gavin: Jack Hinshelwood - 6 - scored the winner (I think?) against Liverpool in their 3-2 win.
- Rebecca: Vitalii Mykolenko - 8 - clean sheet and 2 bonus for Everton's 2-0 win against Southampton.
- Kevin: Ezri Konsa - 15 - Huge week for Konsa with a goal, clean sheet, and 3 bonus against Spurs.
- Jesse: James Justin - 12 - wish I could give this to Vardy for his 200th goal in his 500th appearance. Rest easy king.
- Dylan: Jarrod Bowen - 8 - goal against Nottingham Forest it's what he does even when his team is ass.
- Luke: Omar Marmoush - 8 - speechless. What a goal. He did shoot it with his right across his body though.

With just one week left in May, the manager of the month race is still led by Kevin on PF! Other undefeated managers include Dylan, Darryan, and Gavin!

In terms of form, Kevin and Darryan keep it up with 15/15 points earned! Luke and Scott sit with 12/15 points in the last 5!

And for the final gameweek, you guessed it, great matchups. Headliners include Matt in a must-win matchup against MatthewR, Zach hoping to secure 7th with a win against me, and Luke needing a win against Dylan to secure 3rd in the final week.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (5) vs Zach (7)
- Luke (3) vs Dylan (10)
- Matt (4) vs MatthewR (1)
- Jesse (11) vs Kevin (2)
- Emily (14) vs Rebecca (8)
- Andrew (16) vs Gavin (6)
- Soph (15) vs Darryan (9)
- Coop (13) vs Scott (12)

The Run In

This week has sealed the fate for some, with only a couple of managers being able to make progress.

Top 4

Luke's win over Zach and Matt's loss against Dylan puts the former in the driver's seat for 3rd. However, he does go up against Dylan who has picked up some surprising wins during the run in. Matt's opponent is MatthewR, which isn't an easy matchup but it's one he must win to have a chance at 3rd.

Relegation

Dylan and Jesse's wins put them firmly outside of the relegation zone and Coop fell just short against Darryan in what turned out to be a must-win match. Scott's 127 PF lead over Coop all but seals his fate to 13th. (Or 14th should Emily win and he lose)

---

Shoutout to Kevin for 8 in a row! Darryan has picked up 6 wins on the trot, plus Dylan and Gavin both have 3 in a row!
