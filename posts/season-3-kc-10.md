Welcome to the final gameweek of the Kickoff Cup! Since the final is **not** two legged, the winner between these two managers this week will get a cash prize plus mystery kit! But first, let's recap!

Last week we saw Zach look to overcome an 11 point deficit against me, which he ultimately did not do successfully, losing on aggregate 76-55. On the other side of the bracket, Kevin had to overcome his own 10-point definicit in the second leg. While he did win, he unfortunately fell just short, losing to Scott on aggregate 58-57. Absolutely heartbreaking to come so close to a finals appearance for Kevin.

So that means, yes, we will be having a Gribbins derby in the final: Me vs Scott!

This is my 3rd (out of 3) cup finals appearance over the past 2 seasons. My road to the finals included a group-topping 9 points including victories over Darryan, Jesse, and Soph, which set me up against Emily in the Round of 16. I swept that series with an aggregate score of 67-40 and faced off against Dylan in the quarterfinals. Dylan took a first leg lead of 3 points, which I overcame to win 76-68. Similarly, I then put up a 76 point performance against Zach's 55 in the semifinals.

This is Scott's first finals appearance, and first tournament making it past the first round/out of groups! Scott's road also began with topping his group, but with only 6 points and narrowly beating Dylan and Rebecca on Points For. The two matchups he won in groups were against Dylan and Zach. This set him up for a tumultuous bracket run, which he started by taking fairly straightforward Round of 16 win against Coop 64-52. The next round against Darryan looked to be a lock when he took the first leg 47-31, but Darryan threatened to come back into it, winning the second leg 44-30. Which was just enough for Scott to squeeze by, 77-75. The next leg against Kevin looked oh so similar, as Scott took a 10 point lead in the first leg, just to _nearly_ squander it in the second, winning the tie 58-57.

Fortunately for Scott, we are only playing 1 leg this week, so it should be a fascinating matchup!

Here is the current state of the bracket!

- Matthew 76-55 Zach
