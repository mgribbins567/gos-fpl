Happy gameweek 17! Waivers this week are due at the usual time- Friday at 3am PST / 6am EST! This week had some very close and interesting matchups, led by Coop's dramatic 31-30 upset over Jesse. Elsewhere, Scott also took an upset over Matt in a 45-42 shootout, Darryan took a 41-24 win against Luke, and Dylan took a narrow 29-24 win over Rebecca.

Full results are as follows:

- Andrew 15-27 Matthew
- Soph 37-18 Emily
- Coop 31-30 Jesse
- Scott 45-42 Matt
- Darryan 41-24 Luke

<br/>

These results see some levelling of the table. Starting at the top, MatthewR's lead over 2nd extends to 14 points over Matt. 1 point behind Matt is now me, 1 point behind me is now Jesse, 1 point behind Jesse is now Dylan, and 1 point behind Dylan is now Luke. Zach and Rebecca are joined just 3 points off Luke, and Kevin remains just 2 back of them. Just 1 point behind Kevin is the group of Gavin and Coop, with Darryan a further 1 point behind them having leapfrogged Emily this week. Soph and Scott pull within 2 and 3 points respectively of Emily with their wins this week.

Now onto the Game Changers! This week sees 4 new names woah!

- Matthew: Enes Unal - In what turned out to be somehow the right play for me this week, Unal scored an incredible free kick to nab 3 bonus points and 8 total points in just 10 minutes of playtime.
- Soph: Amad Diallo - An incredible performance for Diallo against Manchester City led to a tight angle goal, penalty win assist, and 3 bonus points (for 13 total), granting Soph (and United) wins this week.
- Coop: Dejan Kulusevski - Our resident Spurs fan must be happy with their huge 5-0 win over Southampton and Kulu's 8 point return from a goal and clean sheet point.
- Scott: Son Heung-Min - Scott's week looked over until Son picked up a massive goal, 2 assists, and 2 bonus points in his 45 minute appearance this weekend. His 14 point haul led Scott's team to a big upset over Matt.
- Darryan: Cody Gakpo - Darryan's well rounded performance was led by a diving header from the Dutchman - Cody Gakpo - off a great Salah cross, notching him 9 points off a goal and 3 bonus in Liverpool's draw against Fulham.
- Gavin: James Maddison - Had Maddison's tweet given him an extra assist, Gavin would have tied the season high score, but nope just a 15 pointer from 2 goals and 3 bonus points for him. And a win against the 4th highest score this week.
- Dylan: Gabriel Magalhaes - In a low scoring match against Rebecca (and against Everton), big Gabriel's clean sheet and 3 bonus points proved to be the difference as he gifted Dylan 9 points this week.
- MatthewR: Tyrick Mitchell - Fortunately for MatthewR, Mitchell was subbed off *before* Brighton wiped Crystal Palace's clean sheet. That, plus his assist and 2 bonus points led MatthewR's team with an 11 point performance.


We are now halfway through December! And we have just 1 undefeated manager: MatthewR (of course). 3 more weeks so anything can happen!
