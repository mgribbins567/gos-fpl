Happy gameweek 21! This late update was made possible by Carabao/FA cup matches throughout the week as waivers are due tomorrow at 10am PST / 1pm EST! This week saw a number of interesting results, as Kevin upset Matt in a very high scoring 53-51 match, Coop took a 26-23 win over me, and Zach defeated Dylan 47-25.

Full results are as follows:

- Coop 26-23 Matthew
- Scott 24-33 Soph
- Darryan 44-20 Andrew
- Gavin 40-13 Emily
- Rebecca 33-39 Jesse
- Kevin 53-51 Matt
- MatthewR 44-30 Luke
- Dylan 25-47 Zach

<br/>

This week sees MatthewR push his lead in 1st back up to 15 points as Matt drops points this week, still 4 points ahead of Luke. Jesse and Kevin sit just behind him with their wins and Zach joins the group from 33-36 points vying for 3rd, increasing the gap between 7th and 8th to 5 points. Gavin and Coop move up the board with their wins, joining Emily on 27 points, just 1 off a top-half spot. Soph's win also allows her to leapfrog Rebecca in the table.

Now onto the Game Changers!

- Coop: Chris Wood - Wood keeps his great form this season going with a goal and 2 bonus being just enough for 8 total points and a victory for Coop.
- Soph: Amad Diallo - As United pick up an unlikely 2-2 draw away at Anfield, Amad picks up a goal and 3 bonus for a total of 9 points and his 2nd appearance here this season.
- Darryan: Raul Jimenez - As Jiminez breaks the record for most goals scored by a Mexican player in the premier league, he nets both goals (and takes home 3 bonus) against Ipswich this week for 13 points on Darryan's behalf.
- Gavin: Savio - As someone finally figures out they should maybe just put in a cross to Haaland, Savio picks up 3 assists and 2 bonus points in their win over West Ham for 13 total.
- Jesse: Dean Huijsen - The new Bournemouth center back pairing keeps the clean sheets coming as Huijsen picks up 2 bonus points for his efforts, for an 8 point return for Jesse.
- Kevin: Morgan Gibbs-White - Despite not being Kevin's highest scorer, I do have to give MGW the game changer position this week. Kevin was down by 6 points going into the final match of the week: Wolves vs Nottingham Forest. That meant he needed a goal from MGW, and he did provide that, plus a clean sheet point, for 8 points and a 53-51 victory for Kevin this week. Shoutout to Kerkez for 12 points from an assist and cs (and 3 bonus) though.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - His 8th appearance on this list and 7th double digit week this season, Palmer picked up Chelsea's lone goal in their 1-1 draw against Palace for 10 points. (he automatically gets 3 bonus points every week)
- Zach: Sepp van den Berg - Zach makes a great move on the waiver wire this week picking up Van den Berg against Southampton, who picked up an assist, clean sheet, and 1 bonus point for a 10 point haul.

In terms of January Manager of the Month, Kevin takes an early lead with 53 PF! Zach, Darryan, MatthewR, and Gavin all sit in the 40+ PF range but there are still 2 more weeks of this short month!

In terms of the form table, MatthewR remains at the top with 13/15 points earned! Just behind him sits Kevin and Soph who have picked up 12/15 possible points!

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by Luke vs Kevin! Elsewhere, we will see me vs Dylan, Zach vs MatthewR, and what should be an interesting Gribbins derby between Andrew and Scott.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (6) vs Dylan (8)
- Zach (7) vs MatthewR (1)
- Luke (3) vs Kevin (5)
- Matt (2) vs Rebecca (13)
- Jesse (4) vs Gavin (9)
- Emily (11) vs Darryan (14)
- Andrew (16) vs Scott (15)
- Soph (12) vs Coop (10)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 10 unbeaten streak! Also shoutout to Kevin for 4 in a row, and Soph and Zach for 2 in a row!
