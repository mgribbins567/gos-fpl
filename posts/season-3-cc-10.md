Consolation Bracket, much more interesting! Leading it off with Scott just barely hanging onto his 15 point lead coming into the second leg, beating Soph on aggregate by just 3! We also saw an incredible 110 point performance from Emily against Dylan, along with my own comeback from an 18 point deficit to take the tie 88-76!
