Hello everybody and welcome to gameweek 2 of the Champions Cup! This week saw a number of upsets and close matchups, headlined by a narrow 30-28 win for Gavin over Coop in Group B. Over in Group C, we saw an upset for Emily over Zach, 39-35, and a similar scoreline (-10) in Group D where Dylan took a win over Luke, 29-24. Darryan as well picked up an upset in Group D over me, 43-34, to see himself to the top of the group alongside Dylan.

Full results are as follows:

**Group A**

- MatthewR 49-26 Andrew
- Jesse 14-61 Rebecca

**Group B**

- Matt 67-34 Scott
- Gavin 30-28 Coop

**Group C**

- Kevin 45-27 Soph
- Zach 35-39 Emily

**Group D**

- Luke 24-29 Dylan
- Matthew 34-43 Darryan

Looking ahead to next week, we'll see some great matchups, starting with what should be a good one between MatthewR and Rebecca in Group A. Elsewhere, Gavin will hope to put himself in a good spot going into week 3 with a win against Scott, and Luke will hope to avenge this week's result against Darryan.

**Group A**

- MatthewR vs Rebecca
- Jesse vs Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt vs Coop
- Gavin vs Scott

**Group C**

- Kevin vs Emily
- Zach vs Soph

**Group D**

- Luke vs Darryan
- Matthew vs Dylan
