Hello everybody and welcome to the Champions Cup! If you need a reminder of what this tournament looks like, check out the announcement here: <u>[https://www.gosfpl.com/posts/champions-tournament-24](https://www.gosfpl.com/posts/champions-tournament-24)</u>

As a brief reminder, the current stage is **Group Stage 1**! There will be no elimination at this stage, but your finish in this group will determine what group you are placed in for **Group Stage 2**, with the top finishers of Group Stage 1 receiving the ability to _choose their opponent in the first knockout stage round_!

So without further ado... here are the groups!

**Group A**

- MatthewR
- Jesse
- Rebecca
- Andrew

**Group B**

- Matt
- Gavin
- Coop
- Scott

**Group C**

- Kevin
- Zach
- Emily
- Soph

**Group D**

- Luke
- Matthew
- Darryan
- Dylan

Definitely some tough groups here, cough cough Group D.

Next up are the matchups for this week! Somehow this time we have avoided all double gameweeks off the bat, so that's pretty cool.

**Group A**

- MatthewR vs Andrew
- Jesse vs Rebecca

**Group B**

- Matt vs Scott
- Gavin vs Coop

**Group C**

- Kevin vs Soph
- Zach vs Emily

**Group D**

- Luke vs Dylan
- Matthew vs Darryan

And here's the picture for those who need a visual!
