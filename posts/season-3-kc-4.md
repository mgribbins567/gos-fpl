Happy gameweek 4 of the kickoff cup! Last week was the final week of groups, so with that, our bracket has been set! But first... how did the final matchday turn out?

# Group A

Surprisingly, Group A is the only group to have the 1st place finisher on 9 points, as I took a 38-32 win over Darryan this week. Jesse also claimed the 3rd place spot over Soph in their head-to-head, at that match finished 36-26.

- Matthew 38-32 Darryan
- Jesse 36-26 Soph

<p class="center-bold">Group A</p>

| Pos | Manager | W   | D   | L   | PF  | P   |
| :-- | :------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1   | Matthew | 3   | 0   | 0   | 116 | 9   |
| 2   | Darryan | 2   | 0   | 1   | 103 | 6   |
| 3   | Jesse   | 1   | 0   | 2   | 92  | 3   |
| 4   | Soph    | 0   | 0   | 3   | 65  | 0   |

# Group B

Perhaps the closest of the 4 groups, Group B proved to surprise. Coming into this week, Kevin and Gavin were in the driver seats: both on 4 points ahead of Andrew on 3, and not facing off against one another. Unfortunately for them, they both lost! Which means Andrew has taken 1st in Group B with less than 100 points for.

- Gavin 13-21 Andrew
- Kevin 18-36 Coop

<p class="center-bold">Group B</p>

| Pos | Manager | W   | D   | L   | PF  | P   |
| :-- | :------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1   | Andrew  | 2   | 0   | 1   | 93  | 6   |
| 2   | Kevin   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 98  | 4   |
| 3   | Gavin   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 69  | 4   |
| 4   | Coop    | 1   | 0   | 2   | 80  | 3   |

# Group C

Group C came down to the wire, with Dylan needing a win to fight for 2nd, Zach a win to even get into the mix, and Scott sitting pretty at the top. And it went to the very end, with Scott clinching 1st despite losing and Dylan beating Rebecca to 2nd by just 2 Points For.

- Dylan 26-25 Zach
- Scott 21-33 Rebecca

<p class="center-bold">Group C</p>

| Pos | Manager | W   | D   | L   | PF  | P   |
| :-- | :------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1   | Scott   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 126 | 6   |
| 2   | Dylan   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 106 | 6   |
| 3   | Rebecca | 2   | 0   | 1   | 104 | 6   |
| 4   | Zach    | 0   | 0   | 3   | 86  | 0   |

# Group D

And finally, Group D! Somehow, the most improbable of results occurred with MatthewR and Luke drawing, causing MatthewR to win the group over Matt's surge of points this week.

- Luke 41-41 MatthewR
- Emily 20-63 Matt

<p class="center-bold">Group D</p>

| Pos | Manager  | W   | D   | L   | PF  | P   |
| :-- | :------- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1   | MatthewR | 2   | 1   | 0   | 140 | 7   |
| 2   | Matt     | 2   | 0   | 1   | 157 | 6   |
| 3   | Luke     | 1   | 1   | 1   | 120 | 4   |
| 4   | Emily    | 0   | 0   | 3   | 59  | 0   |

# Group Stage Recap

<p class="center-bold">Group Stage</p>
<img src="/images/season-3/season-3-wu/4/group-stage.png" width="1200vh" height="auto">
<br />

In what was quite an interesting group stage, I think it is fair to say my coefficient rankings _did not_ accurately reflect how teams would finish in their groups. In fact, the only managers I got correct were:

- The entirety of Group A
- Kevin finishing 2nd and Coop 4th in Group B

The rest were completely wrong, with Andrew and Scott picking up group wins over Gavin and Dylan respectively, and Matt and Rebecca each picking up a solid 6 points in groups.

It is cool to see that _every_ group had a different outcome. Here's some fun stats!

| Group | Sum | Average PF | Average Per Week |
| :---- | :-- | :--------- | :--------------- |
| A     | 376 | 94         | 31.33            |
| B     | 340 | 85         | 28.33            |
| C     | 422 | 106        | 35.17            |
| D     | 476 | 119        | 39.67            |

As you can see, Group D was the group of death, averaging almost 40 points per week. Makes sense when you see 3/4 of the highest PF scorers in the league are in that group. Group C and A had good showings as well, with some solid performances as Scott, me, Dylan, Darryan, and Rebecca all garnered over 100 Points For. Group B, despite it being an unpredictable street fight, was not nearly as high scoring as the other groups, _averaging over 10 points per week less_ than Group D. Despite not winning the group, Kevin was the standout with 98 PF over the first 3 weeks.

All in all, a successful group stage! Despite the lack of elimination.

And on that note...

# The Bracket

Welcome to the elimination stage! Over the next 7 gameweeks, teams will be eliminated until we have just one standing. And as a quick reminder, all matchups leading up to the final will be **two-legged**, while the final will occur on a single gameweek - Gameweek 10. This means that a matchup will consist of both week's scores, added together. In the case of a draw, I'll come up with a tiebreaker :) (will likely be either league standing or PF based). That said, let's get into the Round of 16 matchups! These were drawn as 1 vs 4 seeds and 2 vs 3 seeds, with the earliest you can be paired against a manager from your group being the Semi Final.

**Left Side**

- Matthew vs Emily
- Dylan vs Gavin

<br />

- Matt vs Jesse
- Andrew vs Zach

**Left Side**

- Scott vs Coop
- Darryan vs Luke

<br />

- Kevin vs Rebecca
- MatthewR vs Soph
