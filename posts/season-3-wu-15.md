Happy gameweek 15! Another quick turnaround this gameweek with waivers due tomorrow morning at 3am PST / 6am EST! This week saw a good mix of blowouts and super close matchups, led by the shootout between Gavin and Rebecca, which was won by the latter 55-51! Elsewhere, Zach scraped by with a win against Soph 29-28, Coop upset Dylan 30-23, and Jesse ends his slide with a 33-23 win against me.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 23-33 Jesse
- Emily 7-44 Matt
- Andrew 17-41 Luke
- Soph 28-29 Zach
- Coop 30-23 Dylan
- Scott 17-43 MatthewR
- Darryan 31-62 Kevin
- Gavin 51-55 Rebecca

<br/>

These results made a handful of table changes, as the congestion around 3rd and 9th increases. Starting at the top, MatthewR (of course) keeps his 11 point lead over Matt, with Jesse moving up into 3rd, just 2 points off Matt. Dylan drops to 4th, 1 point behind Jesse, and with Luke, me, and Rebecca all just 1 point behind him. Zach's win brings him into the conversation in 8th, just 3 points off the pack. Kevin also makes a leap up the table to 9th, 2 points behind Zach and 1 ahead of Gavin, Coop, and Emily.

Now onto the Game Changers! Another low scoring week, with just 3 10+ point hauls on the list.

- Jesse: Dwight McNeil - Everton's talisman and their team's destruction of Wolves this week resulted in 2 assists and a clean sheet point for McNeil, leading Jesse's team to victory with 9 points.
- Matt: Mikkel Damsgaard - He outscored Emily's team himself with 9 points (a goal and 2 bonus points). I don't think I need say more.
- Luke: Morgan Rogers - Rogers had a great goal this week against Brentford to nab a bonus point and 8 points for Luke's team, which he also didn't necessarily need in his own lopsided fixture.
- Zach: Declan Rice - Opposite the last 2, Zach's game changer was _very_ necessary for his win. And _of course_ I had to choose Declan Rice, who picked up an assist off a corner, a clean sheet point, and 1 bonus in Arsenal's win against United for a 7 pointer.
- Coop: Noni Madueke - Another huge win for Chelsea this week with Madueke picking up a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points for Coop's team. His 13 points led the team to their narrow win in the low scoring matchup against Dylan.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - Yeah he stole a goal from Nkunku and got 7 points and MatthewR won again.
- Kevin: Alex Iwobi - With Iwobi's second appearance on this list, his 2 goals and 3 bonus points provided Kevin with a huge 15 point haul today. That brings the ex-Arsenal and ex-Everton man up to 8(!!) goal contributions on the season.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - I mean, who else? He hasn't scored less than 9 in the past 7 weeks and once again puts himself on this list with an 18 pointer from 2 goals, an assist, and 3 bonus points. 6th time here out of 8 possible, btw.

The December Manager of the Month race sees Kevin off to a slight lead with his 62 PF, ahead of Rebecca at 55 and a small group in the 40s! Again, this is a long month, so anyone can win it!

In terms of the form table, Rebecca takes the top spot on PF as a group of 5 sits on 12/15 points gained across the past 5 weeks. She shares the seat with Kevin, MatthewR, Zach, and Emily.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by two in-form teams in Rebecca vs Kevin! Elsewhere, Gavin takes on MatthewR, Emily and I face off, and Coop looks to pull off an upset against Luke!

Full matchups are as follows:

- Emily (12) vs Matthew (6)
- Andrew (16) vs Jesse (3)
- Soph (14) vs Matt (2)
- Coop (11) vs Luke (5)
- Scott (15) vs Zach (8)
- Darryan (13) vs Dylan (4)
- Gavin (10) vs MatthewR (1)
- Rebecca (7) vs Kevin (9)

Shoutout this week to MatthewR for his 4 winstreak! Zach and Kevin also sit on 2 winstreaks, and shoutout to the latter for the 60+ pointer, the 6th of the season and first since GW7!
