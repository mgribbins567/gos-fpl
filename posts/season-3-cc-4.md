Hello everybody and welcome to gameweek 4 of the Champions Cup! That means we are entering **Group Stage 2**! But first, let's see how the previous week went, shall we?

# Group Stage 1

**Group A**

This week saw a wild coincidence, as both Jesse and Andrew scored 15 points... against the other 2 managers in this group. That means Rebecca and MatthewR took the top 2 spots, with Andrew and Jesse rounding out the group.

- MatthewR 46-15 Jesse
- Rebecca 51-15 Andrew

**Group B**

Group B was slightly more interesting, as Gavin picked up his required win over Matt, but not by enough to secure first. The same happened to Coop, who defeated Scott handedly, yet could not reach 3rd on PF.

- Matt 26-39 Gavin
- Coop 50-33 Scott

**Group C**

Group C saw one of our more interesting matchups between Kevin and Zach. Unfortunately for Kevin, though, his 35 points was not enough as Zach leapfrogs him in the table. Soph's win does the same, as she picks up a 3rd place finish with her win over Emily.

- Kevin 35-41 Zach
- Emily 16-39 Soph

**Group D**

And finally, Group D. My dumb ass team couldn't buy a win in the cup and lost handedly to Luke. Unfortunately for the latter though, my dumb ass team also couldn't beat Dylan's, so the extra point from our tie keeps him out of 1st.

- Luke 42-17 Matthew
- Darryan 23-31 Dylan

And that's it! **Group Stage 1** complete! Here's the final table:

# Group Stage 2

And we're back at it with **Group Stage 2**! As a reminder, these groups are based on where you finished in the first group stage, with Group E (the top group), gaining the ability to choose their opponent in the Round of 16 in a few weeks! So, let's introduce the groups:

**Group E**

Group A Winner: Rebecca
Group B Winner: Matt
Group C Winner: Zach
Group D WInner: Dylan

Gameweek 29 matchups:

- Rebecca vs Dylan
- Zach vs Matt

**Group F**

Group A Runner-Up: MatthewR
Group B Runner-Up: Gavin
Group C Runner-Up: Kevin
Group D Runner-Up: Luke

Gameweek 29 matchups:

- MatthewR vs Gavin
- Kevin vs Luke

**Group G**

Group A Third: Andrew
Group B Third: Scott
Group C Third: Soph
Group D Third: Darryan

Gameweek 29 matchups:

- Scott vs Andrew
- Soph vs Darryan

**Group H**

Group A Fourth: Jesse
Group B Fourth: Coop
Group C Fourth: Emily
Group D Fourth: Matthew

Gameweek 29 matchups:

- Coop vs Jesse
- Emily vs Matthew

<br />

These groups were sorted in their own tables for seeding, then matched up as usual (1vs4, 1vs3, 1vs2 and so on). Darryan and Soph actually tied, so Soph took the tie on Form by 1 PF. Not that it makes a difference really. I also had to resort the matchups in Group F because there were a couple of double gameweeks, can't have that can we.

Anyway, congrats to those in Group E! They now battle it out to determine who gets priority when picking their opponent in the Round of 16! And everyone else gets to battle it out to _not_ be able to be picked, plus getting a higher seed in the knockouts!

Obviously the Group E and F matchups will always be interesting, but Soph and Darryan have had _extremely_ similar form, so that could be a good one as well!
