Happy gameweek 28! We get a bit of a break this week with waivers due Friday, March 7th at 3am PST / 6am EST! This week saw some very close matchups including some upsets, starting with Scott's high scoring 55-49 win against Rebecca! Elsewhere, Andrew picked up his 4th win of the season in a narrow 42-37 win over Dylan, Gavin snuck by Darryan 34-29, and to round out the 5-point victories I beat Matt 37-32.

Full results are as follows:

- Matthew 37-32 Matt
- Jesse 14-32 Luke
- Emily 18-70 Zach
- Andrew 42-37 Dylan
- Soph 29-46 MatthewR
- Coop 29-39 Kevin
- Scott 55-49 Rebecca
- Darryan 29-34 Gavin

<br/>

This week sees a bit of movement across the table, with ever-present MatthewR getting even closer to wrapping up the title early as I extend his lead to 15 points. Kevin's win puts him even on points now with Matt, with me sitting 6 points behind in 4th. Zach leapfrogs Luke on PF to move up to 5th, just 1 point behind me. Just 2 wins below Luke sits Gavin, who moves back up to 7th with his win, seeing Rebecca drop back to 8th. Further down, Scott jumps up to 13th, pushing Darryan and Soph further into the danger zone. And at the bottom, **Andrew hits a huge 3 to cut the gap to 16**.

Now onto the Game Changers! A few new names this week and a return to low scoring top scorers!

- Matthew: Tosin Adarabioyo - Despite being scammed out of a bonus point, Tosin's reemergence on my team came with an assist and clean sheet in Chelsea's 4-0 win over Southampton for a total return of 9 points.
- Luke: Morgan Rogers - A positive for Luke this week as he enters double suspension hell from a Dorgu red card (joining Zabarnyi). Rogers scored Villa's lone goal in their 4-1 loss to Crystal Palace, picking up a 7 pointer.
- Zach: Ismaila Sarr - On the opposite end of the field, Sarr had himself a game, picking up a brace and 3 bonus points for a 15 point haul and Zach's 4th double digit scorer of the week.
- Andrew: Yoane Wissa - A big performance from Wissa (and Andrew's team as a whole), as the striker leapt like a salmon to score Brentford's only goal in their 1-1 draw against Everton and pick up an additional 3 bonus points. That made a team high 9 points for Andrew this week.
- MatthewR: Dominik Szoboszlai - Back to back appearances on this list for the Hungarian (I'm not spelling his name again) as he picked up another goal, clean sheet point, and 3 bonus en route to Liverpool's 2-0 win over Newcastle. That takes his total to 5g7a on the season and a couple of big returns while Cole Palmer has been snoozing.
- Kevin: Pedro Neto - The ex-Wolves player had himself a big week at striker, scoring and assisting for Chelsea and returning 11 points to lead Kevin to yet another win.
- Scott: Ederson - With his second appearance here in the past 3 weeks, Ederson came up big for Scott with a clean sheet, 6 saves, and all 3 bonus points from Manchester City's 1-0 win over Spurs. Yet again an 11 pointer from the keeper.
- Gavin: Jean-Philippe Mateta - Second half of the season Crystal Palace shows up yet again, as Mateta scored and nabbed 2 bonus points, taking his total to 12 goals on the season and a 4th return in a row. (and 7 in his last 8!)

Congratulations to Kevin for winning his second Manager of the Month! Scott's win takes Rebecca out of contention and Kevin narrowly beat MatthewR by just 2 points to win!

In terms of the form table, Kevin returns to the top as the sole manager to pick up 15/15 possible points! Rebecca, me, Luke, and MatthewR sit just behind at 12/15 points gathered.

- Kevin (3) vs Gavin (7)
