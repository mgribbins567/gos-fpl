Hello all and welcome to gameweek 8 and the quarter finals! This week had some great matches, headlined by an absolute heart breaker as Soph falls just short, losing 69-71 to Luke. Elsewhere, Andrew pulled off the upset over Matt, sending him to the next round, Rebecca narrowly beat Scott 31-26, and Zach took the first round against Jesse 33-25.

Full Results:

**Top Half**

- Zach 33-25 Jesse
- Gavin 40-60 MatthewR

<br />

- Rebecca 31-26 Scott
- Luke 71-69 Soph

**Bottom Half**

- Dylan 21-31 Coop
- Darryan 42-33 Emily

<br />

- Matt 33-37 Andrew
- Matthew 27-44 Kevin

That leaves just 4 pairings this round! And a reminder that these are two-legged ties, so anything can happen.

**Top Half**

- Zach vs MatthewR
- Rebecca vs Luke

**Bottom Half**

- Coop vs Darryan
- Andrew vs Kevin

Some really good matchups this round (looking at you Zach vs MatthewR) and it'll be really interesting to see who sits in the final from the bottom half!

And of course, we have our consolation bracket too! And somehow it came alphabetically sorted?

**Top Half**

- Jesse vs Gavin
- Scott vs Soph

**Bottom Half**

- Dylan vs Emily
- Matt vs Matthew

Of course the Matt(hew) derby in the consolation bracket stands out, but there are certainly some interesting managers remaining to compete for the glory of 9th place.
