Hello everybody and welcome to gameweek 6 of the Champions Cup! Also known as Gameweek 3 of **Group Stage 2**! As this format is ought to do, we saw some very close matches this week, so let's get right into it!

**Group E**

Group E has thus far not lived up to its Group Stage 1 results, putting up only the 3rd most points out of all 4 groups. This week saw Zach cement his spot at the top with his 34-26 win against Dylan, while Matt earned himself some points in a 38-10 victory over Rebecca.

Results (for those who like skipping the prose):

- Rebecca 10-38 Matt
- Zach 34-26 Dylan

Next week will see Zach looking to confirm the first choice of opponent in the Round of 16 with a matchup against Rebecca, while the winner of Matt vs Dylan will be trying to overcome the PF deficit that Zach has built over the past 2 weeks.

- Rebecca vs Zach
- Matt vs Dylan

**Group F**

Group F saw some excitement this week, with MatthewR putting some points on the board with his dramatic 30-29 win over Kevin. On the other Hand, Luke's solid 9 point win over Gavin puts him in prime position to take 1st in that group.

- MatthewR 30-29 Kevin
- Gavin 37-46 Luke

Next week sees MatthewR look to overcome a 41 point deficit against Luke, and Kevin taking on Gavin to try to pick up his first points of this group stage.

- MatthewR vs Luke
- Kevin vs Gavin

**Group G**

Group G had a deficit of just **4 points** across the two matches, with Darryan taking top spot in the group following his 25-23 win against Scott, and Soph moving up the board with her 30-28 win over Andrew.

- Scott 23-25 Darryan
- Soph 30-28 Andrew

Next week will see Darryan look to secure his seeding with a match against Andrew, while Soph and Scott hope to pick up a win and overcome the points for deficit with Andrew to move out of the bottom 2.

- Scott vs Soph
- Darryan vs Andrew

**Group H**

And finally, Group H, where I've taken a solid lead at the top after my second 52 pointer of this group stage, this time against Coop's second 27 pointer of this group stage. Emily also picked up 3 points off Jesse in her 39-18 win.

- Coop 27-52 Matthew
- Emily 39-18 Jesse

Next week sees me look to go 3/3 in this group against Jesse (another 52 pointer maybe?), while the winner of Coop vs Emily will be guaranteed a spot in the top 2.

- Coop vs Emily
- Matthew vs Jesse

Okay, I know it's kinda complicated and honestly idk if this whole double group stage thing works without elimination, but we're learning together and if you're bored it'll be over in like 3 days. Now, for those in **Group E**, you will receive an email/discord ping on Monday, April 7th, in the evening. You'll have a few days (probably until Thursday evening) to respond to this and let me know your ranking / choice for the Round of 16. I will also provide a ranked list that will be used in the case of non responses, made up of the bottom 6 from the other 3 groups.

Side note - in my announcement I did an example ranking based on Group Stage 2 form, I'm not sure if that's entirely fair, so I may revisit this and base it on form from _both group stages_.

For everyone else, I'll be drawing Round of 16 matchups as soon as I get their responses in and we'll go from there! Seeding is based on where you finish in your group, who Group E chooses, and what group you are in. It'll all be as fair as I can make it, so hopefully you trust me.
