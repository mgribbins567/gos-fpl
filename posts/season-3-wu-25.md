Happy gameweek 25! This week has a super quick turnaround due to a Friday match, with waivers due tomorrow at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST! And once again we will see a double gameweek, with Liverpool (again) and Aston Villa playing twice! This week saw very few surprise results, with the most interesting being Rebecca dropping the highest score of the season in her 84-39 win over Coop. Elsewhere, Luke upset Matt 43-27 and Kevin had the narrowest win of the week (yeah..) in a 34-24 match against Soph.

Full results are as follows:

- Darryan 32-58 Matthew
- Gavin 45-33 Scott
- Rebecca 84-39 Coop
- Kevin 34-24 Soph
- MatthewR 27-16 Andrew
- Dylan 33-45 Emily
- Zach 62-17 Jesse
- Luke 43-27 Matt

<br/>

This week sees the least amount of movement we've seen in a while. MatthewR's lead at the top extends to 12 points over Matt due to his loss, with Kevin, me, Luke, Zach, and Gavin all picking up 3 points to keep pace. Jesse's loss sits him now 4 points off Gavin, and Rebecca's win has her leapfrog Coop on points for, just 2 points behind Jesse. Emily's win puts her a win behind Coop, ahead of Darryan, Dylan, and Soph.

Now onto the Game Changers! As expected, this week was the highest scoring of the season, but with only 3 more points than 2nd most!

- Matthew: James Tarkowski - A huge week from the big man as the Moyesiah coaches him to 17 points off an assist and clean sheet (and 1 bonus) against Leicester in their 4-0 win, alongside the game tying goal against Liverpool to make it 2-2.
- Gavin: Jean-Philippe Mateta - The annual Crystal Palace resurgence sees Mateta on the scoresheet twice against Manchester United in their 2-0 win, netting the Frenchman 3 bonus points and 13 total points for Gavin. That's 6 goals in the last 5 games for the first rounder.
- Rebecca: Mohamed Salah - I mean, of course. Across Liverpool's 2-0 win against Bournemouth and 2-2 draw with Everton, the Egyptian picked up 3 goals, an assist, one clean sheet point, and 6 bonus points. That's 29 points on the week and **251** this season (the record is 303, held by Salah 2017/2018).
- Kevin: Morgan Gibbs-White - Kevin needed a haul from MGW this week and he sure got it as Nottingham Forest absolutely obliterated Brighton 7-0 - like, 2 weeks ago now? Gibbs-White scored, assisted twice, and picked up a clean sheet point en route to _2 bonus points_ and 16 total to lead Kevin to victory.
- MatthewR: Cole Palmer - MatthewR received a favorable matchup this week, as Palmer picked up a measly 6 points off an assist and 2 bonus points to eke out a win.
- Emily: Matheus Cunha - Certainly an interesting week scorewise for Emily with 4 7-pointers, one of which coming from Matheus Cunha, who picked up a goal and 2 bonus points for his as Wolves took a 2-0 win against Villa.
- Zach: Neco Williams - One of only 2 players from the 7-0 match on this list, Williams scored one of the goals (who knows which at this point) and picked up a clean sheet, for a very respectable 12 pointer.
- Luke: Kai Havertz - Luke's own first rounder leaves him a departing gift (hamstring injury, out for the season) of 12 points as Arsenal dismantle Manchester City 5-1. Havertz nabbed a goal, assist, and 3 bonus points in the process.

This month is just getting started as they've somehow stuffed 4 gameweeks into February! Rebecca obviously takes an early points for lead with 84, followed by Zach at 62 and me at 58.

In terms of the form table, Kevin is joined by Gavin at 15/15 points collected in the last 5! Zach sits just behind them with 12/15 gained.

Next week will see some great matchups, headlined by a top 5 matchup between me and Luke! Elsewhere, Matt takes on Zach in what should be a high scoring one, Coop looks to upset Gavin in a midtable matchup, and Scott takes on Darryan in what should be an interesting match between two teams down on their luck.

Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (4) vs Luke (5)
- Matt (2) vs Zach (6)
- Jesse (8) vs Dylan (13)
- Emily (11) vs MatthewR (1)
- Andrew (16) vs Kevin (3)
- Soph (14) vs Rebecca (9)
- Coop (10) vs Gavin (7)
- Scott (15) vs Darryan (12)

Shoutout this week to Kevin for his 8 winstreak! Also shoutouts to Gavin for 5 in a row, Rebecca for 3 in a row, and Luke and myself for grabbing back to back wins!
