Happy gameweek 5! This week's waivers are due Friday at 3am PDT / 6am EDT once again! This week saw some great matchups, headlined by our closest matchup of the week: a 32-29 win by Dylan over Zach! Elsewhere, I took a narrow 34-29 victory against Coop, Jesse continued his winstreak (somehow) with a 24-20 win against Rebecca, MatthewR picked up a 5th win in a 43-36 match against Luke, and Matt once again has put up the weekly high in a 54-31 performance against Kevin.

Full results are as follows:

- Coop 29-34 Matthew
- Scott 30-49 Soph
- Darryan 39-23 Andrew
- Gavin 32-18 Emily
- Rebecca 20-24 Jesse
- Kevin 31-54 Matt
- MatthewR 43-36 Luke
- Dylan 32-29 Zach

This week sees the rich grow richer as MatthewR and Jesse continue their winning ways with 15 points each, just 2 points ahead of Matt, whose lead has grown to 4 points above the 3 teams sitting on 9. Across the bottom half, myself and Gavin gain ground, as the latter picks up his first win of the season. Even still, just 3 points separates 8th and 16th, so a lot to play for (and plenty of weeks to do it)!

Next up, the Game Changers! A lot of the usuals this week, along with some fun new names!

- Matthew: Iliman Ndiaye - One benefit of doing this sort of list is introducing everyone to new players! This Everton winger picked up a nice goal and 2 bonus points (for a total 8 points) to lead my team from the FWD spot! Yay another starting FWD!
- Soph: Trent Alexander-Arnold - Trent has done it again, picking up his 100th goal involvement for Liverpool (an assist, surprise surprise) along with a clean sheet and 2 bonus to take him to a very respectable 11 points this week.
- Darryan: Diogo Dalot - As much as it pains Darryan, his team picks up yet another win off the back of a solid performance from a Manchester United player. A clean sheet and 3 bonus points is enough for 9 points and a comfortable win for Darryan this week.
- Gavin: James Maddison - Continuing his rich form (2nd(?) highest xA in the league), Maddison picked up a lefty goal(!?), an assist, and 3 bonus points to provide Gavin with 12 points and a win this week.
- Jesse: Stephy Mavididi - Another newcomer! Mavididi picked up the lone Leicester goal in their match along with 3 bonus points to contribute a solid 42% of Jesse's points this week with 10/24.
- Matt: Luis Diaz - Diaz continues his streak of improving his high score of the season by 1 point (14, 15, 16 this week) in a 2 goal and 3 bonus point performance this gameweek. Yes somehow, this is his first appearance on this list. Weird.
- MatthewR: Nicolas JACKson - An emphatic 2 goals, an assist, and 3 bonus for Nicolas Jackson (16 total) in their win against West Ham this week. Somehow, he's scored more goals in the past year than basically all of the big names? Who would've thought?
- Dylan: Dean Henderson - Henderson put in a solid shift at the weekend, picking up 7 saves, a clean sheet, and 2 bonus points en route to a 0-0 draw against Manchester United and a very narrow Dylan victory. Game = Changed.

Two-thirds of the way into September and we have 4 winning teams: Soph, MatthewR, Dylan, and Jesse. Soph is out to a commanding 28 points for lead heading into the final week, but anything can happen!

Form table still on pause until next week!!

Next week will see some great matchups! The closest leaderboard matchup we have this week is me vs Dylan, which should be interesting, but we also have a couple of derbies! This is the 2nd (I think) Gribbins derby of the season with Andrew taking on Scott, along with our Soph vs Coop derby (name pending)! Other matchups to watch for include Zach vs MatthewR and Jesse vs Gavin, as the two league frontrunners hope to extend their winstreaks by one more week. Full matchups are as follows:

- Matthew (9) vs Dylan (5)
- Zach (11) vs MatthewR (1)
- Luke (4) vs Kevin (13)
- Matt (3) vs Rebecca (10)
- Jesse (2) vs Gavin (14)
- Emily (16) vs Darryan (7)
- Andrew (15) vs Scott (8)
- Soph (6) vs Coop (12)

Shoutout this week to our two remaining 5 winstreaks: MatthewR and Jesse! And Matt for 5 undefeated! This week also sees Dylan and Soph put together 2 winstreaks, and Darryan a 2 undefeated streak.
