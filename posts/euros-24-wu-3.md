Hello all and welcome to matchday 4 of the Euros! The group stage has completed and now there are only 16 teams remaining. Due to this, you will be granted unlimited transfers! The deadline is in ~2.5 days, at 12pm est on Friday! With the first round of the knockouts set, we witnessed some great games! Including the lowest scoring group of the euros ever _cough_ thanks Southgate _cough_, the first time a team has been knocked out with 4 points, sorry Ukraine :\(, upsets such as Romania topping their group (that includes Belgium) and Austria topping their group (containing France and the Netherlands (shoutout Ralf Rangnick)), and something like 19 cards given out in the match between Turkey and Czechia.

With that, the round of 16 has been set.

**Left Side**

- Spain vs Georgia
- Germany vs Denmark

- Portugal vs Slovenia
- France vs Belgium

**Right Side**

- Romania vs Netherlands
- Austria vs Turkey

- England vs Slovakia
- Switzerland vs Italy

With Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, and Belgium all on one side of the bracket, we definitely have a good chance of a smaller country reaching the finals from the right. That is as long as England, Italy, and the Netherlands keep up with their current form.

In terms of our league, Zach keeps his top spot with the highest point tally of the week of 51, taking his total to 175 points. His team was lead by captain Mbappe, who picked up 12 points with the armband (and face mask), Crystal Palace and Denmark defenseman Joachim Andersen who picked up 8, and a man of the match performance from Christian Eriksen who garnered another 7. He now takes a 10 point lead over MatthewR on 165 heading into this first knockout round. I have dropped back to 3rd after a disappointing week, just ahead of the pack sitting individually on every number from 151-147. Weird.
